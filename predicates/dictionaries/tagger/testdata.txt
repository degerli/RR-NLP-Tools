The problem addressed in this paper is the determination of three-dimensional structures of centrosymmetric crystals from X-ray diffraction measurements.
The `minimal principle' that a certain quantity is minimized only by the crystal structure is employed to solve the phase problem.
The mathematical formulation of the minimal principle is a nonconvex nonlinear optimization problem.
"To date, local optimization techniques and advanced computer architectures have been used to solve this problem, which may have a very large number of local optima."
"In this paper, the minimal principle model is reformulated for the case of centrosymmetric structures into an integer programming problem in terms of the missing phases."
This formulation is solvable by well established combinatorial optimization techniques that are guaranteed to provide the global optimum in a finite number of steps without explicit enumeration of all possible combinations of phases.
Computational experience with the proposed method on a number of structures of moderate complexity is provided and demonstrates that the approach yields a fast and reliable method that resolves the crystallographic phase problem for the case of centrosymmetric structures.
"The structure of large block copolymer micelles is traditionally determined by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), covering a large range of scattering vectors and employing contrast variation to determine the overall micelle morphology as well as the internal structure on shorter length scales."
"The present work shows that the same information can be obtained by combining static light scattering (SLS) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), which provide information on, respectively, large and short length scales."
Micelles of a series of block copolymers of poly(ethylene propylene)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEP ndash PEO) in a 70% ethanol solution are investigated.
The polymers have identical PEP blocks of 5.0 emsp14 kDa and varying PEO blocks of 2.8 ndash 49 emsp14 kDa.
"The SLS contrasts of PEP and PEO are similar, providing a homogeneous contrast, making SLS ideal for determining the overall micelle morphology."
"The SAXS contrasts of the two components are very different, allowing for resolution of the internal micelle structure."
A core ndash shell model with a PEP core and PEO corona is fitted simultaneously to the SAXS and SLS data using the different contrasts of the two blocks for each technique.
"With increasing PEO molecular weight, a transition from cylindrical to spherical micelles is observed."
"This transition cannot be identified from the SAXS data alone, but only from the SLS data."
Oscillations have been observed in the tails of the Darwin curve from thin specimens of silicon.
Dynamical theory predicts such oscillations (Pendell ouml sung) for plane wave incident conditions in which two wave points on the same branch of the dispersion surface interfere and produce beating in the diffracted intensity.
The usual Pendell ouml sung is observed in transmission in which beating occurs between wavefields on different branches of the dispersion surface related by spherical rather than plane wave conditions.
The present experiment uses an asymmetrically cut first crystal to increase the effective width of the incident wave and therefore approach the plane wave condition.
Quantitative fringe measurements versus thickness are in fair agreement with theory.
The intensity and contrast of the fringes are in poor agreement with theory.
Several of the more important factors which reduce the contrast are discussed.
"With a relatively simple assumption, the observed and expected intensity dislocations can be brought into good agreement."

The structure of Mycobacterium smegmatis single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) has been determined using three data sets collected from related crystals.
"The structure is similar to that of its homologue from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, indicating that the clamp arrangement that stabilizes the dimer and the ellipsoidal shape of the tetramer are characteristic features of mycobacterial SSBs."
"The central OB fold is conserved in mycobacterial SSBs as well as those from Escherichia coli, Deinococcus radiodurans and human mitochondria."
"However, the quaternary structure exhibits considerable variability."
The observed plasticity of the subunit is related to this variability.
The crystal structures and modelling provide a rationale for the variability.
"The strand involved in the clamp mechanism, which leads to higher stability of the tetramer, appears to occur in all high-G+C Gram-positive bacteria."
The higher stability is perhaps required by these organisms.
The mode of DNA binding of mycobacterial SSBs is different from that of E. coli SSB partly on account of the difference in the shape of the tetramers.
Another difference between the two modes is that the former contains additional ionic interactions and is more susceptible to salt concentration.

Protein crystallization generally consists of an initial screen followed by optimization of promising conditions.
"Whereas the initial screen typically uses a standard set of pre-made crystallization cocktails, optimization requires new cocktails with small perturbations of the original composition."
"Highly parallel synchronous crystallization robots are ideal for initial screening, but they depend on pre-made crystallization cocktails."
"Asynchronous crystallization robots can create crystallization cocktails from stock solutions, but in practice this ability is rarely exploited."
"Instead, large-scale operations typically use a general liquid-handling robot to create optimization screens, whereas academics mostly rely on manual optimization."
"Here, the use of an asynchronous crystallization robot to create customized crystallization cocktails and set up nanovolume crystallization experiments without a compromise in speed or drop quality is described."
"This approach avoids the complex integration of hardware, software and dataflow between two robots and saves cost and space."
"As a proof of principle, a commercial crystal screen has been reproduced with the robot and shows that results are virtually identical to using the actual commercial screen."

Non-
crystallographic (NC) nets are periodic nets characterized by the existence of non-trivial bounded automorphisms.
Such automorphisms cannot be associated with any crystallographic symmetry in realizations of the net by crystal structures.
"It is shown that bounded automorphisms of finite order form a normal subgroup F(N) of the automorphism group of NC nets (N, T)."
"As a consequence, NC nets are unstable nets (they display vertex collisions in any barycentric representation) and, conversely, stable nets are crystallographic nets."
The labelled quotient graphs of NC nets are characterized by the existence of an equivoltage partition (a partition of the vertex set that preserves label vectors over edges between cells).
A classification of NC nets is proposed on the basis of (i) their relationship to the crystallographic net with a homeomorphic barycentric representation and (ii) the structure of the subgroup F(N).

One of the best-studied examples of a class
beta -lactamase
#NAME?
"In this class of enzymes, the active-site serine residue takes on the role of a nucleophile and carries out  beta -lactam hydrolysis."
"Here, the structures of the wild-type and the S70G enzyme determined to 1.55 and 2.1 emsp14  Aring , respectively, are presented."
"In contrast to the previously reported 1.8 emsp14  Aring  structure, the active site of the wild-type enzyme (1.55 emsp14  Aring ) structure does not contain sulfate and Ser70 appears to be in the deprotonated form."
The X-ray crystal structure of the S70G mutant has an altered Ser130 side-chain conformation that influences the positions of water molecules in the active site.
This change allows an additional water molecule to be positioned similarly to the serine hydroxyl in the wild-type enzyme.
The structure of the mutant enzyme suggests that this water molecule can assume the role of an active-site nucleophile and carry out noncovalent catalysis.
"The drop in activity in the mutant enzyme is comparable to the drop observed in an analogous mutation of the nucleophilic serine in alkaline phosphatase, suggesting common chemical principles in the utilization of nucleophilic serine in the active site of different enzymes."
A method is described for enantiomorphic space-group determination which depends upon a simple analysis of a single convergent-beam diffraction pattern.
"The method, which in principle may be applied to any enantiomorph, is here used to identify the space group of dextrorotatory  alpha -quartz."
"In this, a four-beam pattern is analysed by visual matching to an analogue computer display."
"dUTP pyrophosphatase (dUTPase) cleaves the  alpha - beta  phosphodiester of dUTP to form pyrophosphate and dUMP, preventing incorporation of uracil into DNA and providing the substrate for thymine synthesis."
"Seven crystal structures of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) dUTPase in three crystal forms have been determined, including complexes with substrate (dUTP), product (dUMP) or inhibitor (dUDP) bound."
The native enzyme has been refined at 1.40 emsp14  Aring  resolution in a hexagonal crystal form and at 2.3 emsp14  Aring  resolution in an orthorhombic crystal form.
"In the dUDP complex in a cubic crystal form refined at 2.5 emsp14  Aring  resolution, the C-terminal conserved P-loop motif is fully ordered."
"The analysis defines the roles of five sequence motifs in interaction with uracil, deoxyribose and the  alpha -,  beta - and  gamma -phosphates."
The enzyme utilizes adaptive recognition to bind the  alpha - and  beta -phosphates.
"In particular, the  alpha - beta  phosphodiester adopts an unfavorable eclipsed conformation in the presence of the P-loop."
This conformation may be relevant to the mechanism of  alpha - beta  phosphodiester bond cleavage.

One of the main interests in the molecular biosciences is in understanding structure ndash function relations and X-ray crystallography plays a major role in this.
ACORN can be used as a comprehensive and efficient phasing procedure for the determination of protein structures when atomic resolution data are available.
An initial model can automatically be built by ARP/wARP followed by REFMAC for refinement.
The  alpha  helices and  beta  sheets occurring in many protein structures can be taken as starting fragments for structure solution in ACORN.
"ACORN, along with ARP/wARP followed by REFMAC, can be an ab initio method for solving protein structure for which data are better than 1.2  "
Attempts are here made in extending its applications to real data at 1.45  Aring  resolution and also to truncated data at 1.6  Aring  resolution.
"Two previously known structures, congerin II and alkaline cellulase N257, were resolved using the above approach."
"Automatic structure solution, phasing and refinement for real data at still lower resolutions for proteins of various complexities are being carried out."
Data mining of the secondary structural features using PDB is being carried out for this new approach for `seed-phasing' to ACORN.
"The crystal structure of endothiapepsin complexed with the gem-diol inhibitor PD-135,040 has been anisotropically refined to a resolution of 1.37 emsp14  Aring ."
The structure of this inhibitor complex is in agreement with previous structures of endothiapepsin gem-diol inhibitor complexes that have been used to develop proposed catalytic mechanisms.
"However, the increase in resolution over previous structures confirms the presence of a number of short hydrogen bonds within the active site that are likely to play an important role in the catalytic mechanism."
The presence of low-barrier hydrogen bonds was indicated in a previous one-dimensional H NMR spectrum.
The crystal structure of a recombinant triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) from the archaeabacterium Methanocaldococcus jannaschii has been determined at a resolution of 2.3 emsp14  Aring  using X-ray diffraction data from a tetartohedrally twinned crystal.
"M. jannaschii TIM (MjTIM) is tetrameric, as suggested by solution studies and from the crystal structure, as is the case for two other structurally characterized archaeal TIMs."
"The archaeabacterial TIMs are shorter compared with the dimeric TIMs; the insertions in the dimeric TIMs occur in the vicinity of the tetramer interface, resulting in a hindrance to tetramerization in the dimeric TIMs."
The charge distribution on the surface of the archaeal TIMs also facilitates tetramerization.
Analysis of the barrel interactions in TIMs suggests that these interactions are unlikely to account for the thermal stability of the archaeal TIMs.
A novelty of the unliganded structure of MjTIM is the complete absence of electron density for the loop 6 residues.
The disorder of this loop could be ascribed to a missing salt bridge between residues at the N- and C-terminal ends of the loop in MjTIM.
The class B non-specific acid phosphatase AphA from Escherichia coli has been expressed in E. coli and purified following a new protocol.
ESI mass spectroscopy shows that the purified enzyme solution contains two polypeptides with molecular weights differing by 185 emsp14 Da corresponding to two different cleavage sites of the signal peptide from the AphA E. coli precursor.
"Despite the solution heterogeneity, X-ray quality crystals have been obtained."
"However, the crystals have a tendency to give polymorphs and to lose long-range order with time while maintaining an intact crystal habit."
Crystals have been grown in space groups I222 and C2 with three different unit cells and different asymmetric unit contents.
Diffraction data to 1.6 emsp14  Aring  resolution have been collected with synchrotron radiation at ESRF and DESY.
"Acetolactate decarboxylase has the unique ability to decarboxylate both enantiomers of acetolactate to give a single enantiomer of the decarboxylation product, (R)-acetoin."
A gene coding for  alpha -acetolactate decarboxylase from Bacillus brevis (ATCC 11031) was cloned and overexpressed in B. subtilis.
The enzyme was purified in two steps to homogeneity prior to crystallization.
Three different diffraction-quality crystal forms were obtained by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method using a number of screening conditions.
"The best crystal form is suitable for structural studies and was grown from solutions containing 20% PEG 2000 MME, 10 emsp14 mM cadmium chloride and 0.1 M Tris ndash HCl pH 7.0."
"They grew to a maximum dimension of approximately 0.4 emsp14 mm and belong to the trigonal space group P31,221, with unit-cell parameters a = 47.0, c = 198.9 emsp14  Aring ."
A complete data set was collected to 2 emsp14  Aring  from a single native crystal using synchrotron radiation.
"Potassium sodium silver tetraniobium nonaoxide arsenate, K0.12Na0.54Ag0.34Nb4AsO13, synthesized by solid-state reaction at 1123 emsp14 K, adopts a three-dimensional framework delimiting tunnels running along [001] in which occupationally disordered sodium, silver, and potassium ions are located."
"Of the 11 atoms in the asymmetric unit (two Nb, one As, one Ag, one K, one Na and fiveO), nine are located on special positions:"
"one Nb and the K, Ag, Na and two O atoms are situated on mirror planes, the other Nb is on a twofold rotation axis, and the As atom and one O atom are on sites of m2m symmetry."
A model involving only a small number of parameters provides a convenient way of interpreting diffraction patterns from MCM-41 materials.
"Each parameter of the model has a clear physical meaning, and this approach is clearly superior to extracting pore structure information by fitting Gaussians to an observed diffraction pattern."
"The harmonic model of atomic nuclear motions is usually enough for multipole modelling of high-resolution X-ray diffraction data; however, in some molecular crystals, such as 1-(2 prime -aminophenyl)-2-methyl-4-nitro-1H-imidazole [Paul, Kubicki, Jelsch et al."
"B67, 365 ndash 378], it may not be sufficient for a correct description of the charge-density distribution."
Multipole refinement using harmonic atom vibrations does not lead to the best electron density model in this case and the so-called `shashlik-like' pattern of positive and negative residual electron density peaks is observed in the vicinity of some atoms.
"This slight disorder, which cannot be modelled by split atoms, was solved using third-order anharmonic nuclear motion (ANM) parameters."
"Multipole refinement of the experimental high-resolution X-ray diffraction data of 1-(2 prime -aminophenyl)-2-methyl-4-nitro-1H-imidazole at three different temperatures (10, 35 and 70 emsp14 K) and a series of powder diffraction experiments (20  le  T  le  300 emsp14 K) were performed to relate this anharmonicity observed for several light atoms (N atoms of amino and nitro groups, and O atoms of nitro groups) to an isomorphic phase transition reflected by a change in the b cell parameter around 65 emsp14 K. The observed disorder may result from the coexistence of domains of two phases over a large temperature range, as shown by low-temperature powder diffraction."
Advances in cryocrystallographic techniques for macromolecular crystallography have been intimately intertwined with efforts to reduce the deleterious effects of X-ray damage inflicted during the collection of diffraction data.
A brief overview of cryomethods and their rationale is given.
"followed by a summary of our current limited understanding of radiation damage in cryocooled crystals, investigations aimed at minimizing its effects and finally some developments which actually utilize it both for phasing and to extend structural knowledge."
Simulated annealing is used to solve the X-ray phase problem formulated as a minimization problem.
"The cost function consists of two parts, one represents the discrepancy between measured and calculated intensities while the other monitors the probability distribution of the triplets."
"From a random real-space structure at the start, the atoms are moved one by one to gradually reduce the cost function until the best structure emerges."
Trial calculations for structures including hexadecaisoleucinomycin (HEXIL) are presented.
Comparison of this method with other related methods is made.
"The objective of any modern data-processing program is to produce from a set of diffraction images a set of indices (hkls) with their associated intensities (and estimates of their uncertainties), together with an accurate estimate of the crystal unit-cell parameters."
"This procedure should not only be reliable, but should involve an absolute minimum of user intervention."
The process can be conveniently divided into three stages.
The first (autoindexing) determines the unit-cell parameters and the orientation of the crystal.
The unit-cell parameters may indicate the likely Laue group of the crystal.
The second step is to refine the initial estimate of the unit-cell parameters and also the crystal mosaicity using a procedure known as post-refinement.
"The third step is to integrate the images, which consists of predicting the positions of the Bragg reflections on each image and obtaining an estimate of the intensity of each reflection and its uncertainty."
This is carried out while simultaneously refining various detector and crystal parameters.
"Basic features of the algorithms employed for each of these three separate steps are described, principally with reference to the program MOSFLM."
"A simple physical model of the relationship between crystallite size and disorder for paracrystalline materials is presented, based on the spiral paracrystal and distortion of the lattice cells."
Simulations show that the model leads to relationships similar to the \alpha^{*} rule.
Average crystallite sizes predicted by the model are in agreement with experimental data and also allow crystallite-size distributions to be proposed.
The model provides a more satisfactory and complete explanation of this relationship than do current descriptions.
The crystal structure of the hypothetical protein MPN555 from Mycoplasma pneumoniae (gi|1673958) has been determined to a resolution of 2.8 emsp14  Aring  using anomalous diffraction data at the Se-peak wavelength.
Structure determination revealed a mostly  alpha -helical protein with a three-lobed shape.
The three lobes or fingers delineate a central binding groove and additional grooves between lobes 1 and 3 and between lobes 2 and 3.
"For one of the molecules in the asymmetric unit, the central binding pocket was filled with a peptide from the uncleaved N-terminal affinity tag."
The MPN555 structure has structural homology to two bacterial chaperone proteins: SurA and trigger factor from Escherichia coli.
The structural data and the homology to other chaperone proteins suggests an involvement in protein folding as a molecular chaperone for MPN555.
"The title compound, [Pd2(C4H13N3)2(C14H16N2)](NO3)4, comprises discrete tetracationic dumbbell-type dinuclear complex molecules and noncoordinating nitrate anions."
"Two Pd(dien)2+ moieties (dien is diethylenetriamine) are joined by the rigid linear exo-bidentate bridging 2,2 prime ,6,6 prime -tetramethyl-4,4 prime -bipyridine ligand to form the dinuclear complex, which lies across a centre of inversion in the space group P21/n, so that the rings in the 2,2 prime ,6,6 prime -tetramethyl-4,4 prime -bipyridine bridging ligand are parallel."
"In the crystal, the primary and secondary amino groups of the dien ligand act as hydrogen-bond donors towards the nitrate anions to form a three-dimensional hydrogen-bond network."
"An extensive computer program has been developed to check the internal consistency of published, numeric, crystallographic data prior to storage in the data files of the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre."
The coding is in Fortran IV for an IBM 3701165 with 1 megabyte store.
"The atomic coordinates, constitution and connectivity of the unique bonded residue(s) are determined from the published asymmetric unit coordinates."
"Bond lengths are calculated and compared with published values, and any discrepancies are flagged."
Checks are made to ensure that the valency requirements of certain elemental types are not violated.
The connectivity of the system is expressed in a compact notation.
Axial projection plots may optionally be produced on the line printer.
The program is likely to be generally useful to individual crystallographers at various stages of an analysis as well as for checking of published data.
The type I 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase (DHQase) which catalyses the reversible dehydration of 3-dehydroquinic acid to 3-dehydroshikimic acid is involved in the shikimate pathway for the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds.
"The shikimate pathway is absent in mammals, which makes structural information about DHQase vital for the rational design of antimicrobial drugs and herbicides."
The crystallographic structure of the type I DHQase from Salmonella typhi has now been determined for the native form at 1.78 emsp14  Aring  resolution (R nbsp = nbsp 19.9%; Rfree = 24.7%).
The structure of the modified enzyme to which the product has been covalently bound has also been determined but in a different crystal form (2.1 emsp14  Aring  resolution; R = 17.7%; Rfree = 24.5%).
An analysis of the three available crystal forms has provided information about the physiological dimer interface.
The enzyme relies upon the closure of a lid-like loop to complete its active site.
"As the lid-loop tends to stay in the closed position, dimerization appears to play a role in biasing the arrangement of the loop towards its open position, thus facilitating substrate access."

Oriented lamellar nanocomposites formed of alternating organic and inorganic layers were prepared by evaporation-induced self-assembly and studied by small-angle X-ray scattering in symmetrical and asymmetrical reflection.
Analytical expressions were used for a quantitative fit of the experimental data.
"The fitting procedure leads to a comprehensive characterization of the lamellar two-phase system in terms of the average thicknesses of the lamellae, the average period and the corresponding variances, using both the stacking model and the lattice model."
"Furthermore, the width of the domain boundary and the preferred orientation were determined."

A diffraction theory is developed for the model of ordered zones embedded in an otherwise disordered binary alloy.
Evaluation of the resulting lattice sums gives an equation for the diffuse scattering everywhere in reciprocal space except under the fundamental lines.
"From the experimental diffuse intensity one can calculate the relative volume of the ordered zones in the whole crystal, their mean sizes along each of the crystallographic axes, and the distribution of these sizes."
A set of relations between the Warren short-range-order parameters  alpha lmn and the size of the ordered zones is also obtained.
Comparison with experimental  alpha lmn given in the literature show that a 50 at.% CuAu alloy quenched from 500 deg C contains ordered zones in a disordered matrix.
Similar results were obtained for a 50 at.% CuPt alloy held at 890 deg C or quenched from 930 deg C.

A novel method is presented for the automatic detection of nbsp noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) in macromolecular crystal structure determination which does not require the derivation of molecular masks or the segmentation of density.
It was found that throughout structure determination the NCS-related parts may be differently pronounced in the electron density.
"This often results in the modelling of molecular fragments of variable length and accuracy, especially during automated model-building procedures."
These fragments were used to identify NCS relations in order to aid automated model building and refinement.
"In a number of test nbsp cases higher completeness and greater accuracy of the obtained structures were achieved, specifically at a crystallographic resolution of 2.3 emsp14  Aring  or poorer."
"In the best case, the method allowed the building of up to 15% more residues automatically and a tripling of the average length of the built fragments."

This article describes the structure of scroll nanotubes and associated diffraction effects in the context of electron diffraction from a single nanotube.
It is suggested that the effect of multiple equidistant splitting of diffuse reflections into cone series be used as a diffraction criterion for conical scroll structure identification.
"For cylindrical scroll structure determination, the effect of the azimuthal dependence of the intensity of basal diffraction spots is proposed as a characteristic sign."
Good agreement between specific oscillations in both theoretical and experimental profiles of basal diffraction spots was achieved.
"It was also established that there are special values of chiral angles in cylindrical scroll nanotubes that lead to order enhancement in their structure along the tube axis, whereas even a small deviation from these angles results in degradation of diffraction conditions for some diffraction spots in the diffraction pattern."

A reliable method for the determination of bulk-solvent model parameters and an overall anisotropic scale factor is of increasing importance as structure determination becomes more automated.

An atomic pair distribution function (PDF) neutron powder diffraction round-robin experiment was performed on six diffractometers at three spallation sources.

"Two illustrative samples, a perfectly long-range-ordered element, Pb, and a locally strained alloy ZnSe0.5Te0.5, were measured at low temperatures."

Debye ndash Waller (DW) factors and structure factors have been measured for Si using convergent-beam electron diffraction (CBED) experiments with a transmission electron microscope equipped with a field-emission gun and a post-column energy-filtering device.
Si has been used here to evaluate the accuracy of multi-beam near-zone-axis orientations for the simultaneous refinement of DW factors and multiple structure factors.
"Strong dynamic interactions among different beams are obtained by tilting the crystal to specific four- or six-beam orientations near major zone axes, which provide sufficient sensitivity to determine accurate DW factors and structure factors."
The DW factors of Si were measured using four-beam conditions near the [001] zone axis for temperatures ranging from 96 to 300 emsp14 K. A comparison of the multi-beam near-zone-axis orientations with other CBED methods for DW and structure factor

The temperature below which the DW factor of Ni becomes smaller than that of Al was found to be lower than previously reported.
Structure factors are determined with an accuracy of 0.05% and compared with prior reports.
"Expressions for Bragg's law have been derived for the general case of Bragg diffraction in which an incident beam strikes a crystal surface at an angle  alpha , is then diffracted by planes inclined to the surface by  phiv  and leaves the same surface at an angle  beta ."
The crystal is assumed to have a refractive index n = 1 -  delta  and  lambda  is the X-ray wavelength in air or vacuum.
Under these conditions Bragg's law can be written as  lambda  = 2d(1 -  delta )[cos  phiv  sin ( alpha  -  delta /tan  alpha ) + sin  phiv  cos ( alpha  -  delta /tan  alpha ) cos  sigma ] and  lambda  = 2d(1 -  delta )[cos  phiv  sin ( beta  -  delta /tan  beta ) + sin  phiv  cos ( beta  -  delta /tan  beta ) cos  tau ].  
"sigma  and  tau  are dihedral angles defined in terms of N, the normal to the crystal surface"
"d*, the normal to the diffracting planes; -s0, a ray in air antiparallel to the incident beam and s, the diffracted ray in the air.  "
"sigma  is the angle between (-s0, N) and (d*, N) and  tau  the angle between (s, N) and"
"When the plane of diffraction contains N,  sigma  and  "
are either 0 or 180 deg  and Bragg's law takes the form  lambda  = 2d(1 -  delta ) sin ( alpha  -  delta /tan  alpha   plusmn   phiv ) +  phiv  for  sigma  = 0 deg  -  phiv  for  sigma  = 180 deg   lambda  = 2d(1 -  delta ) sin ( beta -  delta /tan  beta   plusmn   phiv ) +  phiv  for  tau  = 0 deg  -  phiv  for  tau  = 180 deg .
"The magnitude of the refraction effect varies primarily with X-ray wavelength, electron density, and beam-to-crystal angle."
Because of refraction the beam-to-crystal-surface angle required to satisfy Bragg's law can change by 10-4 to 10-1 degrees.
Accurate measurement of the deviation from coincidence orientation for grain boundaries allows the intergranular dislocation structure to be predicted.
"For hexagonal symmetry, the deviation may generally be split into two components: a pure rotation and a deformation."
"This rotation may be determined directly by measuring the displacement of rational common zone axes across the grain boundary plane, independently of any coincidence site lattice (CSL)."
The precision on the elements of the rotation  ndash  axis and angle  ndash  depends strongly on the sharpness of the Kikuchi lines.
"For deformed and annealed magnesium, a precision of 10 deg  on the axis position and of 0.2 deg  on the rotation angle has been obtained."

The crystal structure of the inactive D140N mutant of Serratia marcescens was refined to 1.45 emsp14  Aring  resolution.
"The structure of the mutant was essentially identical to that of the wild type, with the exception of a rotation of Asp142 in the catalytic centre."
"In the mutant, this residue interacts with the catalytic acid (Glu144) and not with residue 140 as in the wild type."
"Thus, the 500-fold decrease in activity in the D140N mutant seems to be largely mediated by an effect on Asp142, confirming the crucial role of the latter residue in catalysis."

"Eubacterial RibG and yeast Rib2 possess a deaminase domain for pyrimidine deamination in the second and third steps, respectively, of riboflavin biosynthesis."
"These enzymes are specific for ribose and ribitol, respectively."
"Here, the crystal structure of Bacillus subtilis RibG in complex with a deaminase product is reported at 2.56 emsp14  Aring  resolution."
"Two loops move towards the product on substrate binding, resulting in interactions with the ribosyl and phosphate groups and significant conformational changes."
The product carbonyl moiety is bent out of the pyrimidine ring to coordinate to the catalytic zinc ion.
Such distortions in the bound substrate and product may play an essential role in enzyme catalysis.
The yeast Rib2 structure was modelled and a mutational analysis was carried out in order to understand the mechanism of substrate recognition in these two enzymes.
Detailed structural comparisons revealed that the two consecutive carbonyl backbones that occur prior to the PCXXC signature constitute a binding hole for the target amino group of the substrate.
This amino-binding hole is essential in B. subtilis RibG and is also conserved in the RNA/DNA-editing deaminases.

The distinct X-ray transmission profile obtained by scanning a sample in a diamond anvil cell across a collimated X-ray beam is used to monitor sample displacement brought about by rotation.
"This measured displacement can in turn be used to calculate, and subsequently correct, the sample position with respect to a centre of rotation."
"This centring method differs from others also based on transmission in that it does not require a 180 deg  sample rotation, nor does it require prior positioning of the rotation axis in the path of the X-ray beam."
"After a full description of the method, an example is presented together with an extended record of use to evaluate the method in a practical setting."
The practice and benefits of rocking polycrystalline samples during X-ray exposure have also been quantitatively examined.
Changing the orientation of the sample grains with respect to the incident beam yields the expected result of a more homogeneous intensity distribution along Debye rings.
"Interestingly, by limiting the amount of time large grains assume a particular orientation, rocking brings about the added effect of significantly reducing detector saturation."
"Sample rocking yields more reliable relative intensities, a more appropriate line shape and narrower line width."
Data are presented for a calibration standard at ambient pressure as well as a research sample at high pressure.

"In the present work, EhIPPase has been biochemically identified and its crystal structure has been determined in the presence of Mg2+ and PO43 minus  at 2.5 emsp14  Aring  resolution."
"This enzyme was previously classified as a 3 prime (2 prime ),5 prime -bisphosphate nucleotidase in the NCBI, but its biochemical activity and structural analysis suggest that this enzyme behaves more like an inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase."
"The ability of EhIPPase to hydrolyze the smaller Ins(1,4)P2 better than the bulkier 3 prime -phosphoadenosine 5 prime -phosphate (PAP) is explained on the basis of the orientations of amino-acid residues in the binding site."
"This structure is the first of its class to be determined from any protozoan parasite, and is the third to determined among all organisms, following its rat and bovine homologues."
"The three-dimensional fold of EhIPPase is similar to those of other members of the inositol monophosphatase superfamily, which also includes inositol monophosphatase, 3 prime (2 prime ),5 prime -bisphosphate nucleotidase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate 1-phosphatase."
"They all share conserved residues essential for metal binding and substrate hydrolysis, with the motif D-Xn-EE-Xn-DP(I/L)DG(S/T)-Xn-WD-Xn-GG."
"The structure is divided into two domains, namely  alpha + beta  and  alpha / beta , and the substrate and metal ions bind between them."
"However, the ability of each enzyme class to act specifically on its cognate substrate is governed by the class-specific amino-acid residues at the active site."

"Double-crystal rocking Curves from a highly perfect silicon crystal were taken in extremely asymmetric schemes, in which the glancing angles of the incident X-rays were very close to the critical angle of total external reflection."

This paper discusses the experimental realisation of two types of X-ray interferometer based on pinhole diffraction.
In both interferometers the beam splitter was a thin metal foil containing micrometer pinholes to divide the incident X-ray wave into two coherent waves.
The interference pattern was studied using an energy-dispersive detector to simultaneously investigate in a large spectral range the diffraction properties of the white synchrotron radiation.
For a highly absorbing pinhole mask the interference fringes from the classical Young's double-pinhole experiment were recorded and the degree of coherence of X-rays could be determined.
In the case of low absorption of the metal foil at higher X-ray energies ( gt 15 emsp14 keV) the interference pattern of a point diffraction interferometer was observed using the same set-up.

The probabilistic estimate of the solvent content (Matthews probability) was first introduced in 2003.
"Given that the Matthews probability is based on prior information, revisiting the empirical foundation of this widely used solvent-content estimate is appropriate."
The parameter set for the original Matthews probability distribution function employed in MATTPROB has been updated after ten years of rapid PDB growth.
"A new nonparametric kernel density estimator has been implemented to calculate the Matthews probabilities directly from empirical solvent-content data, thus avoiding the need to revise the multiple parameters of the original binned empirical fit function."
The influence and dependency of other possible parameters determining the solvent content of protein crystals have been examined.
Detailed analysis showed that resolution is the primary and dominating model parameter correlated with solvent content.
"Modifications of protein specific density for low molecular weight have no practical effect, and there is no correlation with oligomerization state."
"A weak, and in practice irrelevant, dependency on symmetry and molecular weight is present, but cannot be satisfactorily explained by simple linear or categorical models."
The Bayesian argument that the observed resolution represents only a lower limit for the true diffraction potential of the crystal is maintained.
The new kernel density estimator is implemented as the primary option in the MATTPROB web application at http://www.ruppweb.org/mattprob/.

The C alpha  positions for a protein can provide a scaffold for the reconstruction of more complete models.

"Secondly, it was found that the disruption and formation of salt bridges accompanies DNA binding."

This paper presents a new algorithm to remove the Cu K alpha 2 profile in X-ray powder diffraction patterns.
Previous algorithms for  alpha 2 elimination can be divided into two categories.
The first category assumes the shape identity of the  alpha 1 and  alpha 2 components.
The second category uses parameters by fitting experimental data.
The first category is not accurate and the second one is instrument-dependent.
The algorithm presented here uses the Cu K alpha  emission profile obtained from monolithic double-crystal measurements.
"Therefore, it is more accurate and less instrument-dependent than the previous methods."
This algorithm has been tested and applied in software for diffraction data processing.
The present method can be extended to remove K alpha 2 lines of other radiations.

"X-ray diffraction patterns of two different zeolite-like borosilicates, BOR-C and BOR-D, are subjected to investigation."
The structure of BOR-C is interpreted in terms of a regular stacking of `pentasil' layers correlated by inversion centres (i-type stacking).
"Conversely, the structure of BOR-D may only be described as a layer sequence in which the prevailing i-type stacking is interrupted by faults consisting of mirror-related layers ( sigma -type stacking)."
A statistical model where both the crystal surfaces and the stacking faults (with a 25% probability) are randomly distributed (Bernoullian model) leads to Lorentzian profiles and the resulting calculations show a good fit with experiment.
"In view of the very strong X-ray similarity among BOR-D, the ZSM-11 aluminosilicate and the pure silica analogue silicalite-2, the same statistical model is proposed for the two latter structures."
In situ biaxial tensile tests within the elastic domain were conducted with W/

The process of chemical reaction in a crystal can be observed by stepwise crystal structure analysis if the single-crystal integrity is preserved during the reaction.
Such a reaction is called a `crystalline-state reaction' and the stepwise crystal structure analysis is termed `real-time in situ observation'.

The probable errors of the attenuation coefficients were typically 1%.

The RSV RNA genome is encapsidated and protected by a nucleocapsid protein; this RNA ndash nucleocapsid complex serves as a template for viral replication.
Interest in the nucleocapsid protein has increased owing to its recent identification as the target site for novel anti-RSV compounds.

"In general, modern refinement codes include accurate formulations for most effects; however, the functions used for peak asymmetry are semi-empirical and take very little account of diffraction optics."
The deficiencies in these methods are most obvious for high-resolution instruments.
This study describes the implementation of powder diffraction peak profile formulations devised by van Laar  amp  Yelon [J. Appl.
"1984), 17, 47 ndash 54]."
"This formalism, which describes the asymmetry due to axial divergence in terms of finite sample and detector sizes, does not require any free parameters and contains intrinsic corrections for the angular dependence of the peak shape."
"The method results in an accurate description of the observed profiles for a variety of geometries, including conventional X-ray diffractometers, synchrotron instruments with or without crystal analyzers and neutron diffractometers."
"A simple, low-cost and efficient open-flow cryogenic cooling system has been constructed for crystallographic data collection from flash-cooled protein crystals on the rotation-camera station at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory."
A constant temperature of less than 100 emsp14 K at the crystal position can be maintained for an indefinite period of time.
A small heater surrounding the delivery nozzle and another between the sample crystal and the sample support are used to prevent the formation of ice.
The system includes an automatic filling capability so that the device can be run unattended for up to approximately one week.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein response (UPR) is comprised of several intracellular signaling pathways that alleviate ER stress.
The ER-localized transmembrane kinase PERK is one of three major ER stress transducers.
Oligomerization of PERK's N-terminal ER luminal domain by ER stress promotes PERK trans-autophosphorylation of the C-terminal cytoplasmic kinase domain at multiple residues including Thr980 on the kinase activation loop.
"Activated PERK phosphorylates Ser51 of the  alpha -subunit of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2 alpha ), which inhibits initiation of protein synthesis and reduces the load of unfolded proteins entering the ER."
The crystal structure of PERK's kinase domain has been determined to 2.8 emsp14  Aring  resolution.
The structure resembles the back-to-back dimer observed in the related eIF2 alpha  kinase PKR.
"Phosphorylation of Thr980 stabilizes both the activation loop and helix  alpha G in the C-terminal lobe, preparing the latter for eIF2 alpha  binding."
The structure suggests conservation in the mode of activation of eIF2 alpha  kinases and is consistent with a `line-up' model for PERK activation triggered by oligomerization of its luminal domain.
"A procedure is described that uses a small collimator in the center of the Eulerian cradle for the alignment of the incident beam, the zero positions of the circles and the collimators of a four-circle diffractometer."
The method is applicable also with a large initial misalignment of the diffractometer.
"The results obtained indicate a high reproducibility of the zero-position values, with deviations of the order of the step accuracy of the angle setting."
The Pi sampling method is derived from the incomplete factorial approach to macromolecular crystallization screen design.
The resulting `Pi screens' have a modular distribution of a given set of up to 36 stock solutions.
Maximally diverse conditions can be produced by taking into account the properties of the chemicals used in the formulation and the nbsp concentrations of the corresponding solutions.
The Pi sampling method has been implemented in a web-based application that generates screen formulations and recipes.
It nbsp is nbsp particularly adapted to screens consisting of 96 different conditions.
The flexibility and efficiency of Pi sampling is demonstrated by the crystallization of soluble proteins and of nbsp an integral membrane-protein sample.

X-ray absorption and scattering spectroscopies involving the 3d transition-metal K- and L-edges have a long history in studying inorganic and bioinorganic molecules.
"However, there have been very few studies using the M-edges, which are below 100 emsp14 eV. Synchrotron-based X-ray sources can have higher energy resolution at M-edges."
M-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) could therefore provide complementary information to K- and L-edge spectroscopies.
"In this study, M2,3-edge XAS on several Co, Ni and Cu complexes are measured and their spectral information, such as chemical shifts and covalency effects, are analyzed and discussed."
"In addition, M2,3-edge RIXS on NiO, NiF2 and two other covalent complexes have been performed and different d ndash d transition patterns have been observed."
"Although still preliminary, this work on 3d metal complexes demonstrates the potential to use M-edge XAS and RIXS on more complicated 3d metal complexes in the future."
The potential for using high-sensitivity and high-resolution superconducting tunnel junction X-ray detectors below 100 emsp14 eV is also illustrated and discussed.

Amplitudes in the pre-edge region increased with temperature normally by thermal vibration.
Use of the AIIP peak intensity as a standard point enables a quantitative comparison of the intensity of the pre-edge peaks in various titanium compounds over a wide temperature range.

Both difference electron-density maps and anomalous difference electron-density maps suggest that in crystals grown from a sodium sulfate solution PPE binds Na+ in its metal-binding site.
"In contrast, PPE binds Ca2+ in crystals grown from a solution containing sodium citrate and calcium chloride."
This observation is in contradiction to most PPE structures reported in the PDB.

"The procedure of whole-powder-pattern fitting without reference to a structural model, first proposed by Pawley for use with neutron powder data [J. Appl."
"14, 357 ndash 361], was extended as a tool for analyzing X-ray whole-powder data."
"X-ray data for  alpha -SiO2,  alpha -Al2O3 and CaCO3 used as test samples were first analyzed by individual profile-fitting techniques to establish the angle-dependent profile-shape model."
"Then the results were incorporated into the profile model of whole-powder-pattern fitting, where peak maximum positions of individual reflections are a function of unit-cell parameters while integrated intensities are independent variables."
Whole-powder-pattern fits for the test samples showed that the correction for peak shift has a large influence on the overall fit of the pattern and the accuracy of refined parameters.
It is also important to take into account the asymmetry and the angular dependence of the intensity decay rate in modelling the diffraction profile.
The method developed was applied to an analysis of the powder pattern of a mixed monoclinic tetragonal ZrO2.

Anabolic ornithine transcarbamoylase (aOTC) catalyzes the reaction between carbamoyl phosphate (CP) and L-ornithine (ORN) to form L-citrulline and phosphate in the urea cycle and L-arginine biosynthesis.
The crystal structure of unliganded aOTC from Campylobacter jejuni (Cje aOTC) was determined at 2.7 emsp14  Aring  resolution and refined to an Rwork of 20.3% and an Rfree of 24.0%.
Cje aOTC is a trimer that forms a head-to-head pseudohexamer in the asymmetric unit.
Each monomer is composed of an N-terminal CP-binding domain and a C-terminal ORN-binding domain joined by two interdomain helices.
The Cje aOTC structure presents an open conformation of the enzyme with a relatively flexible orientation of the ORN-binding domain respective to the CP-binding domain.
"The conformation of the B2 ndash H3 loop (residues 68 ndash 78), which is involved in binding CP in an adjacent subunit of the trimer, differs from that seen in homologous proteins with CP bound."
"The loop containing the ORN-binding motif (DxxxSMG, residues 223 ndash 230) has a conformation that is different from those observed in unliganded OTC structures from other species, but is similar to those in structures with bound ORN analogs."
The major differences in tertiary structure between Cje aOTC and human aOTC are described.

"The March function is a widely used preferred-orientation correction function that, in flat-plate geometry, often closely approximates the pole-density profile of axially symmetric textures."
"It is shown that in Debye ndash Scherrer geometry, the assumption that the pole-density profile of a powder specimen can be described by a March function with coefficient R, leads to an intensity correction factor that can be approximated quite well by another March function, with coefficient R minus 1/2."

"Sensing external stress in the bacterial periplasm and signal transduction to the cytoplasm are important functions of the CpxAR, Bae and  sigma E signalling pathways."

The periplasmic protein RseB plays an important role in this pathway by exerting a direct or indirect negative effect on YaeL cleavage efficiency.
"RseB from E. coli, missing the periplasmic signal sequence (RseB Delta N), was cloned, expressed, purified and crystallized."

The patterns were recorded on a sensitive storage-phosphor detector.
"Despite complexities posed by the sharp variation of the incident X-ray spectrum with wavelength and the weakness of the diffraction patterns, accurate crystallographic structure amplitudes were extracted from the Laue intensities by the generalized scale-factor approach to the determination of the wavelength- and position-dependent correction factors."
The results show that crystallography is feasible on the 100 ps time scale and open up the prospect of time-resolved measurements of ultra-rapid changes in molecular structure.

"Phases were obtained from multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD), solvent flattening (SF), molecular replacement (MR) using a 5 emsp14  Aring  resolution electron-density search model, multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) and, finally, electron-density averaging (DA) procedures."
It is shown how the combination of all these techniques was used to overcome problems arising from incompleteness of MAD data and weak phasing power of MIR data.
A real-space refinement (RSR) procedure is described to improve MR solutions and obtain very accurate protein envelopes and non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) transformations from 5 emsp14  Aring  resolution phase information.
These were crucial for the phase extension to high resolution by DA methods.
"With the rise of Bayesian methods in crystallography, the error estimates attached to estimated phases are becoming as important as the phase estimates themselves."
Phase improvement by density modification can cause problems in this environment because the quality of the resulting phases is usually overestimated.
This problem is addressed by an extension of the  gamma  correction [Abrahams (1997).

The degree to which the improved phases are biased by the features of the initial map is investigated in order to determine the limits of the resulting procedure and the quality of the phase-error estimates.

Selenomethionine incorporation is a powerful technique for assigning sequence to regions of electron density at low resolution.
Genetic introduction of methionine point mutations and the subsequent preparation and crystallization of selenomethionyl derivatives permits unambiguous sequence assignment by enabling the placement of the anomalous scatterers (Se atoms) thus introduced.
"Here, the use of this approach in the assignment of sequence in a part of the AP2 clathrin adaptor complex that is responsible for clathrin binding is described."
"AP2 plays a pivotal role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a tightly regulated process in which cell-surface transmembrane proteins are internalized from the plasma membrane by incorporation into lipid-enclosed transport vesicles."
"AP2 binds cargo destined for internalization and recruits clathrin, a large trimeric protein that helps to deform the membrane to produce the transport vesicle."
"By selenomethionine labelling of point mutants, it was shown that the clathrin-binding site is buried within a deep cleft of the AP2 complex."
"A membrane-stimulated conformational change in AP2 releases the clathrin-binding site from autoinhibition, thereby linking clathrin recruitment to membrane localization."
A key challenge in the SAD phasing method is solving a structure when the anomalous signal-to-noise ratio is low.
"Here, algorithms and tools for evaluating and optimizing the useful anomalous correlation and the anomalous signal in a SAD experiment are described."
simple theoretical framework [Terwilliger et al.
"D72, 346 ndash 358] is used to develop methods for planning a SAD experiment, scaling SAD data sets and estimating the useful anomalous correlation and anomalous signal in a SAD data set."
The phenix.plan_sad_experiment tool uses a database of solved and unsolved SAD data sets and the expected characteristics of a SAD data set to estimate the probability that the anomalous substructure will be found in the SAD experiment and the expected map quality that would be obtained if the substructure were found.
"The phenix.scale_and_merge tool scales unmerged SAD data from one or more crystals using local scaling and optimizes the anomalous signal by identifying the systematic differences among data sets, and the phenix.anomalous_signal tool estimates the useful anomalous correlation and anomalous signal after collecting SAD data and estimates the probability that the data set can be solved and the likely figure of merit of phasing."
Serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX) is capable of collecting three-dimensional single-crystal diffraction data using polycrystalline samples.
This may dramatically enhance the power of X-ray powder diffraction.
In this paper a test has been performed using simulated diffraction patterns.
The test sample is a mixture of two zeolites with crystal grain sizes from 100 to 300 emsp14 nm. X-ray diffraction snapshots by SFX were simulated and processed using the program suite CrystFEL.
"Identification according to the primitive unit-cell volume determined from individual snapshots was able to separate the whole set of snapshots into two subsets, which correspond to the two zeolites in the sample."
Monte Carlo integration in CrystFEL was then applied to them separately.
"This led to two sets of three-dimensional single-crystal diffraction intensities, based on which crystal structures of the two zeolites were solved easily by direct methods implemented in the program SHELXD."
Small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS and SANS)
"experiments on solutions provide rapidly decaying scattering curves, often with a poor signal-to-noise ratio, especially at higher angles."
"On modern instruments, the noise is partially compensated for by oversampling, thanks to the fact that the angular increment in the data is small compared with that needed to describe adequately the local behaviour and features of the scattering curve."
"Given a (noisy) experimental data set, an important question arises as to which part of the data still contains useful information and should be taken into account for the interpretation and model building."
"Here, it is demonstrated that, for monodisperse systems, the useful experimental data range is defined by the number of meaningful Shannon channels that can be determined from the data set."
"An algorithm to determine this number and thus the data range is developed, and it is tested on a number of simulated data sets with various noise levels and with different degrees of oversampling, corresponding to typical SAXS/SANS experiments."
The method is implemented in a computer program and examples of its application to analyse the experimental data recorded under various conditions are presented.
"The program can be employed to discard experimental data containing no useful information in automated pipelines, in modelling procedures, and for data deposition or publication."
The software is freely accessible to academic users.
Dermatophagoides farinae is one of the major house dust mite (HDM) species that cause allergic diseases.
"N-terminally His-tagged recombinant Der emsp14 f emsp14 21 (rDer emsp14 f emsp14 21), a group 21 allergen, with the signal peptide truncated was successfully overexpressed in an Escherichia coli expression system."
The purified rDer emsp14 f emsp14 21 protein was initially crystallized using the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method.
"Well diffracting protein crystals were obtained after optimization of the crystallization conditions using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method with a reservoir solution consisting of 0.19 emsp14 M Tris ndash HCl pH 8.0, 32% PEG 400 at 293 emsp14 K. X-ray diffraction data were collected to 1.49 emsp14  Aring  resolution using an in-house X-ray source."
"The crystal belonged to the C-centered monoclinic space group C2, with unit-cell parameters a = 123.46, b = 27.71, c = 90.25 emsp14  Aring ,  beta  ="
125.84 deg .
"Da minus 1 suggests that there are two molecules per asymmetric unit, with a solvent content of 40.3%."
"Despite sharing high sequence identity with Blo emsp14 t emsp14 5 (45%) and Blo emsp14 t emsp14 21 (41%), both of which were determined to be monomeric in solution, size-exclusion chromatography, static light scattering and self-rotation"
function analysis indicate that rDer emsp14 f emsp14 21 is likely to be a dimeric protein.
Polymorphism in molecular crystals is a remarkable property of Nature to create a wide range of various combinations of limited amount of components.
"Studies of the polymorphic crystals upon different types of external influence could be very useful in terms of analysis of molecular packing, nature and dynamics of the intermolecular interactions."
"When applied to pharmaceuticals, crystal structure may noticeably affect on stability, solubility, bioavailability, etc. which are essential for drug development."
Sulfonyl urea derivatives represent a great example of compounds which are potentially inclined to conformational polymorphism.
In particular  generation drug chlorpropamide could be crystallized in a five different polymorphs.
Chlorpropamide molecule is highly flexible in the crystal structure whereby we obtain various types of molecular conformations and their relative arrangements within the main structural forming motif  ndash  directed hydrogen bonded chains.
"Although polymorphic properties of chlorpropamide have been well-known for a decade there are still a lot of open questions regarding relative stability and crystallization conditions of the polymorphs as well as their behavior under extreme conditions such as cryogenic temperatures, hydrostatic pressure and mechanical stress."
In order to follow dynamics of molecular fragments and to observe possible phase transitions on cooling and compression polarized Raman spectroscopy was used.
Low temperature spectra were recorded in a wide temperature (5-300 K) range.
The effect of hydrostatic pressure was studied using diamond anvil cell up to 5  ndash  5.5 GPa.
Nanoindentation was applied to five polymorphs of chlorpropamide to examine and compare their mechanical properties.
Experimental results were also supported by quantum-mechanical calculations.    
"The research was supported by a grant for Russia-Slovenia collaboration BI-RU-12-13-038, a grant from RFBR and the Integration project 108 of the SB RAS."
Twinning is a common known problem in the study of crystal structures from single-crystal data and often related to a high degree of pseudosymmetry of the structure with respect to a higher symmetrical parent one.
"With the rising popularity of in situ single-crystal diffraction studies under high pressure, the occurrence of twinned structures is more and more frequently reported."
"In this contribution, we review the available information on merohedral and pseudomerohedral twinning as well as pseudosymmetry under high pressures [1].  "
"For twinning by merohedry type I (inversion twinning), a reliable characterization of the twin domains and volume fractions is difficult and largely depends on the experimental conditions, i.e., on the number of measured Friedel pairs and the chosen wavelength."
"For twinning by merohedry (type II) and for twinning by pseudomerohedry, twin volume fractions could be reliably determined from high-pressure data for several cases."
"In none of these, a significant influence of hydrostatic pressure on the volume fractions of the individuals was observed.  "
Pressure-induced twinning has also been observed for compounds which undergo first-order phase transitions.
"It is remarkable that the twinning operation in such cases is related to the loss of rotational symmetry elements of the higher symmetrical polymorph, although the high- and low-pressure phases are not in the group-subgroup relationship.  "
The analysis of pseudosymmetry of several compounds as a function of pressure suggests that this parameter can be used to predict the (in)stability of compounds.
"In particular, a decrease in pseudosymmetry seems to be strongly correlated with the occurrence of first-order phase transitions in which the crystals break or amorphize."
"AdpA is the central transcriptional factor in the A-factor regulatory cascade of Streptomyces griseus and activates hundreds of genes required for both secondary metabolism and morphological differentiation, leading to onset of streptomycin biosynthesis as well as aerial mycelium formation and sporulation."
"It has been shown that AdpA binds to over 500 operator regions with the loosely conserved consensus sequence, 5'-TGGCSNGWWY-3' (S: G or C; W: A or T; Y: T or C; and N: any nucleotide)."
"However, it is still obscure how AdpA can control hundreds of genes."
"To reveal the molecular basis of the low nucleotide sequence specificity, we have determined the crystal structure of the complex of DNA-binding domain of AdpA and a 14-mer duplex DNA with two-nucleotide overhangs at 5'-ends at 2.95- Aring  resolution."
"The crystal structure and electrophoretic mobility-shift assays showed that only two arginine residues, Arg262 and Arg266, are involved in the sequence recognition and determine the nucleotide specificity/preference of continuous five base-pairs of positions 1 ndash 5 in the consensus sequence."
These results partially explain how AdpA directly controls hundreds of genes.
   We are interested in crystal structures and stabilities of fluoride materials containing lanthanides and yttrium that are related to the CaF2 structure.
"These compounds are laser hosts and luminescent materials, oxygen sensors as well as components of solar cells."
They exhibit various schemes of (dis)ordering of cations and anions in fluorite superstructures and anion-excess fluorites.    
"In the last few years, we have performed a series of studies on the bulk AMF4 and MF3 materials (A = Li, Na, K; M = Y, lanthanide) at different pressure-temperature conditions."
"Among them, ordered LiYF4 is a commercial host for solid state lasers, while partially ordered NaYF4 doped with lanthanides is the most efficient material for green and blue up-conversion known to date."
"In the system KF ndash YF3, we have studied not only KYF4 [1] but also KY3F10, which is an anion-excess 2 times 2 times 2 superstructure of fluorite at atmospheric conditions."
"At high temperatures and high pressures, it converts to another fluorite superstructure with disordered fluorine atoms."
The pressure-induced LaF3 post-tysonite structure is another example of the anion-excess fluorite [2].    
Our work on the fluorite-related materials at extreme conditions provides information on their structural instabilities that could further be used to better understand and control their materials properties.
"For instance, we demonstrated that the NaMF4 up-converters are unstable and that the ordering of the cations and vacancies in their structure is a slow process [3]."
"Consequently, the order ndash disorder transformations have a profound influence over the luminescent properties of these materials when doped."
"The compound TiOCl is a quasi-1-dimensional (1D) quantum magnet (Seidel et al., 2003)."
"Upon cooling, TiOCl undergoes a phase transition at Tc2 = 90 K towards a state with incommensurate magnetic order, followed by a second phase transition at Tc1 = 67 K towards a spin-Peierls state (Seidel et al.,"
Both low-temperature phases involve structural distortions that have been characterized by x-ray diffraction.  
The absence of any phase transitions has been reported for scandium-doped TiOCl with doping levels 0.01  lt  
"Based on temperature-dependent x-ray diffraction experiments and specific-hear measurements, we have found that the x = 0.005 compound transforms into incommensurate and spin-Peierls-like phases on cooling."
"Despite apparent large correlation lengths, these phases lack long-range order."
A sluggish transformation is thus found between states of ScxTi1-xOCl that support different kinds of fluctuations.
Extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1 and ERK2) are members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family.
Constitutive activation of the ERK proteins contributes to the development and progression of numerous human tumors.
"Thus, ERK1 and ERK2 are promising targets for the design and the development of anticancer drugs."
The detailed structural analysis of ERK complexed with ATP can provide valuable information for the design of new ligands that can bind in the ATP-binding pocket and inhibit ERK activity.
"In this study, the structures of apo-form ERK2 and of its complexes with the substrate ATP and the product ADP were determined."
Comparison with the structural homolog cyclin-dependent kinase 2 reveals differences in the way that the ATP binding to the protein is mediated by magnesium.
"Only minor conformational changes are identified that occur upon substrate binding, and these are limited to the active-site residues."
The enzyme phosphoethanolamine transferase A is involved in the addition of phosphoethanolamine moieties to lipid A in Neisseria meningitidis.
The enzyme is composed of an N-terminal transmembrane domain and a C-terminal soluble domain that is present in the periplasm of the bacteria.
A membrane-deletion construct of the enzyme was designed and expressed in Escherichia coli.
Well ordered crystals that diffracted to 1.7 emsp14  Aring  resolution were obtained by carrying out a limited trypsin digestion of the protein to remove a predicted N-terminal disordered portion.
"The crystals belonged to space group P21, with unit-cell parameters a = 44.3, b = 71.6, c = 49.9 emsp14  Aring ,  beta  = 109.2 deg , and contained one molecule in the asymmetric unit."
"An in-house X-ray scattering system, which can simultaneously measure small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) data, as well Raman scattering data, has been developed to study the phase transitions of polymeric materials."
"To date, these types of measurements have been limited to synchrotron radiation."
The present system is an in-house SAXS system combined with a WAXD detector and a Raman spectrometer.
A rotating-anode X-ray generator and multilayer optic are employed to provide a high-flux X-ray beam.
Two two-dimensional hybrid pixel detectors are utilized for the rapid-scan time-resolved SAXS and WAXD measurements.
The Raman unit consists of a compact probe with a near-infrared excitation laser operating at a wavelength of 1064 emsp14 nm.
This long-wavelength laser produces less fluorescence than conventional excitation lasers with wavelengths of 532 or 785 emsp14 nm.
The performance of this system was tested by investigating the thermally induced ferroelectric phase transition of vinylidene fluoride ndash trifluoroethylene (VDF-TrFE) copolymers.
"It has been demonstrated that the combination of SAXS, WAXD and Raman techniques gives useful information for revealing the relationship between the structural change in the crystal lattice and the morphological change in the lamellar stacking mode in polymer samples of complicated hierarchical structure."
An iteration method is presented for calculation of the gross physical properties of polycrystals in terms of the physical properties of the crystals.
No assumptions are made concerning the shape or behaviour of the crystallites.
The only mathematical condition to be fulfilled is that the product of the matrix of a gross physical property with its inverse must give a unit matrix if the same is valid for the crystals.
The method is demonstrated by the calculation of the effective elastic tensor of a hypothetical texturized polycrystal consisting of Cu crystallites.
The calculated upper and lower bounds of the Young modulus are extremely close to each other.
"A rapid and unique method for centering reflections on a computer-controlled, four-circle neutron diffractometer is presented."
The method is based on numeric differentiation using the three-point form of Stirling's interpolation formula and its most outstanding features are the speed of operation and the high precision of the derived diffractometer coordinates.
Grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering is reported from nanoclusters in superparamagnetic (SPM) polycrystalline Co separated by Au.
The self-organization of the Co nanoclusters is in the form of nanopillar-like structures with high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.
"A distinct signature of regular near-neighbour ordering is observed, which is commonly observed in patterned nanostructures."
The estimated cluster sizes corroborate with those estimated from their magnetic field response.
"Most significantly, the SPM limit for these clusters can be raised to above room temperature ( sim 325 emsp14 K) with an increase in the vertical correlation of the nanopillars."
The slow response time of these uniform nanomagnetic grains (with respect to a 10 emsp14 kHz AC field) suggests their possible usage as potential magnetic storage devices in the form of three-dimensional nanopillars.
RootProf is a multi-purpose program which implements multivariate analysis of unidimensional profiles.
"Series of measurements, performed on related samples or on the same sample by varying some external stimulus, are analysed to find trends in data, classify them and extract quantitative information."
Qualitative analysis is performed by using principal component analysis or correlation analysis.
"In both cases the data set is projected in a latent variable space, where a clustering algorithm classifies data points."
Group separation is quantified by statistical tools.
"Quantitative phase analysis of a series of profiles is implemented by whole-profile fitting or by an unfolding procedure, and relies on a variety of pre-processing methods."
"Supervised quantitative analysis can be applied, provided a priori information on some samples is provided."
"RootProf can be applied to measurements from different techniques, which can be combined by means of a covariance analysis."
A specific analysis for powder diffraction data allows estimation of the average size of crystal domains.
"RootProf borrows its graphics and data analysis capabilities from the Root framework, developed for high-energy physics experiments."
The combined effects of refraction and reflection of fast electrons entering a thin specimen nearly parallel to an interface may be used to obtain quantitative information about the difference in the mean inner Coulomb potential (U0) between the two adjoining phases.
When no strong Bragg reflections are excited the electrons are deflected towards the phase with the largest |U0|.
By tilting the crystal so that strong Bragg reflections are excited some of the Bloch waves may be deflected in the opposite direction.
The effect is demonstrated by simple two-beam calculations and observations for the AI/SiC interface.
"The X-ray crystal structure of the unbound state of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) subtype C protease (C PR) has been determined to 1.20 emsp14  Aring  resolution in the tetragonal space group P41212, with one monomer per asymmetric unit and unit-cell parameters a = 46.7, c = 100.8 emsp14  Aring , allowing full anisotropic least-squares refinement."
"The refined model has a conventional R factor of 14.1% for all reflections and estimated standard deviations in bond lengths and angles for all main-chain non-H atoms of 0.014 emsp14  Aring  and 0.030 deg , respectively."
The structure is compared with three unbound subtype B proteases (B PRs) to identify structural changes arising from the naturally occurring polymorphisms and delineate their implications in antiretroviral drug resistance/susceptibility.
"The unbound C PR exhibits a larger distance between the tips of the flaps, a downward displacement of the 36 ndash 41 loop and an increased thermal stability of the 10s loop when compared with the B PR structures."
The C PR structure presents the highest resolution of the unbound state of a non-subtype-B PR and adds to the understanding of flap dynamics and drug resistance.
"halides, Ph3SnHal with Hal = Cl, Br, and I, are white, low melting solids soluble in many indifferent organic solvents like chloroform or toluene."
"In these solutions as well as in solid they consist of isolated, tetrahedral molecules which intermolecular interactions restricted to van-der Waals ones."
These molecules are characterized through the three aromatic phenyl rings attached at a certain pitch angle around the shaft of the tin-halide bond giving them a propeller-like shape accompanied by molecular chirality as the normal vectors of the blades can be oriented clock-wise or anti-clock-wise with respect to the tin-halide bond.
"In the past, a lot of different polymorphs of triphenyltin(IV) halides with up to 24 molecules in the unit cell have been described, all crystallizing in centrosymmetric space groups, implying that both chiral molecules are present."
From a structural point of view there are still several questions of general interest
enantiomers distributed in these polymorphs
"(ii) how are the molecular dipole moments arranged, and (iii)"
how are the different polymorphs related to each other.
"During various studies on the syntheses and reactivity of triphenyltin(IV) halides we found four additional polymorphs, which constitute new structure types in case of   delta"
"(Z = 8, monoclinic, P21/c), and  egr -Ph3SnI ("
"Z = 12, monoclinic, P21/c) or complete the already existing  alpha -Ph3SnCl structure type (Z = 24, rhomboedric, R-3) in case of  beta -Ph3SnBr and  zeta -Ph3SnI."
"Analysing the new and already known polymorphs with respect to the three questions mentioned above points out (i) the influence of crystal symmetry elements (screw axes and glide planes) as well as (ii) the importance of the formation of supramolecular dimers composed of both enantiomers with an antiparallel orientation of the two molecular dipole moments, on the different structure types formed and their relation among each other."
"Vapochromic materials, which show color change induced by vapors, are expected to be applied to the sensing of volatile organic compounds or humidity.  "
"As for the metal complex crystals, many vapochromic crystals are reported, however, vapochromic organic crystals are not common.  "
"Therefore, it is important to find vapochromic organic crystals and to reveal the mechanistic aspects of structure transformations and color change based on the crystal structures.  "
"Pale brown Enoxacin-3,5-Diaminobenzoic Acid (ENO-3,5DABA) dihydrate cocrystal changed to yellow on exposure to four kinds of alcohol solvent vapors (methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol), and these yellow crystals returned to pale brown dihydrate crystal by humidity, which is called vapochromism.  "
"The single crystals recrystallized from water (pale brown) and methanol (yellow) are equal to the dihydrate and the methanol vapor applied forms, respectively, and their crystal structure determination revealed that the cocrystals are 1:1 salt of ENO and 3,5DABA.  "
"Surprisingly, in the methanol vapor applied from, the crystalline solvent was changed to 0.5-methanol-0.5-water solvate (composition is ENO:3,5DABA:MeOH:H2O=2:2:1:1).  "
Thus the dihydrate cocrystal undergoes solvent exchange transformation on exposure to methanol vapor and the color changes from pale brown to yellow.  
"Because the XRD patterns of the yellow 0.5-methanol-0.5-water solvate cocrystal and the forms exposed to other alcohol solvent vapors shows high similarity, they are isostructure crystals.  "
The color change is caused by the  pi ...
"pi  interaction formation between the ENO molecule and 3,5DABA molecule in alcohol solvate form via solvent exchange transformations."
"Femtosecond-scale XFEL pulses can produce diffraction free from radiation damage, under functional physiological conditions where reaction dynamics can be studied for systems such as photosystem II.  "
"However, it has been extremely difficult to derive accurate structure factors from the data since every shot is a still exposure from a distinct specimen.  "
"Accuracy can be improved by software methods implemented in the program cctbx.xfel, including optimal indexing and retention of data from multiple lattices, and separate determination of the resolution cutoff for individual lattices.  "
"Various techniques can produce well-conforming descriptions of the Bragg spot shape and crystal mosaicity, enabled in part by sub-pixel characterization of the detector geometry.  "
"By carefully discriminating between image pixels known to contain diffraction signal and the surrounding pixels containing only background noise, and by extending postrefinement techniques that lead to a better crystal orientation, we derive accurate structure factors with substantially fewer crystal specimen exposures.  "
"It is hoped that these developments will make it easier to measure small structure factor differences, such as those from anomalous scattering that will enable the de novo determination of macromolecular structure.  "
"ABSTRACT:  Bacterial T4SS are complexes, constituted of 8 to 12 conserved proteins, used by many gram-negative bacteria for the translocation of proteins and DNA-protein complexes as well as for the transportation of DNA-protein complexes across their cell envelope."
"T4SS are excellent model targets for the development of antivirulence drugs as it is an essential virulence factor for many bacterial pathogens, such as Brucella."
"Antivirulence drugs that deprive the pathogen of its essential virulence factor, the T4SS, would constitute alternatives to or enhancements of current antibiotic treatment."
"VirB8, a conserved assembly factor in T4SS forms dimers that are very important for T4SS function in these pathogens."
"Due to its multiple interactions, VirB8 is an excellent model for the analysis of assembly factors but also a possible target for drugs that could target its protein ndash protein interactions, which would disarm bacteria by depriving them of their essential virulence functions."
"Several studies have aimed to better understand coordination polymers, which are structures based on a connection between a metal ion and an organic ligand that extends infinitely, forming a macro-structure1."
"The interest in this type of structure is mainly due to its properties, such as its pore-forming ability, presenting many potential applications2 like selective separations, catalysis and gas storage."
It is interesting to study the structure of coordination polymers to focus in some particular future application.
"In these way, a coordination polymer was synthetized by simple mixture with isonicotinylhydrazine (INH) and 1,2,4,5-benzenetetracarboxylic acid (BTC) ligands and zinc metallic ion."
"Yellow single crystals were formed in solution and one was separated, measured and solved by single crystal X-ray diffraction."
The crystal-data for the structure were collected using an Oxford GEMINI A-Ultra diffractometer with MoK alpha  radiation ( lambda  = 0.71073  Aring ) at room temperature and solved using SHELXL-97 program3.
"The compound crystallized in monoclinic crystalline system in space group P21/c, cell parameters: a=9.2502(6)  Aring ,"
"Aring , c=9.2947(4)  Aring ,  beta ="
"The final statistical parameters of the structure refinement were R=0.0326, wR=0.0835 and S=1,053."
In this compound the BTC and INH ligands are coordinated like a bridge to two zinc ions.
The BTC forms chelates by two carboxylate groups and INH coordinates by pyridine ring and by chelate at hydrazide group.
This polymer extends in only one direction along a axis forming a 1D network.
"There is only one metallic zinc ion crystallographically independent on structure, it is in a distorted octahedral geometry with oxygen and nitrogen atoms of ligands and one coordinated water molecule in its coordination sphere."
The 1D network formed by coordination polymers stabilizes the crystalline arrangement by hydrogen bonds between carboxylate and hydrazide groups and coordinated water molecules.
Proteasomes are the multicatalytic protein complexes with huge molecular weight.
It is well known that the ubiquitin proteasome system plays an important role in regulated proteolysis.
The 26S proteasome is composed of two 19S regulating components and a 20S proteasome.
"The 20S proteasome forms barrel shape and is composed of four rings,  alpha - and  beta -rings; each ring contains highly homological seven  alpha -subunits ("
seven  beta -subunits
N-terminal tails of  alpha
"Each of 1, 2 and 5  beta  ndash subunit has different enzyme activity; 1 is caspase-, 2 tryptic- and 5 chymotryptic- like activity, respectively.  "
"We found a new protease inhibitor compound-A, which interacts weakly against proteasome."
"In order to elucidate the binding mode of the compound-A to proteasome, structure determination of the 20S proteosme complexed with compound-A was carried out."
"Isolated and concentrated 20S proteasome was co-crystallized with compound-A. Sitting drop vapor diffusion method was applied using 0.1M MES-NaOH (pH 6.5), 35% MPD, 50 mM magnesium acetate as a reservoir solution and 10 mg/ml proteasome and 20 mM"
compound-A as a sample solution.
Crystals are isomorphous with the previous report [1].
"Diffraction images were recorded at 100 K by using ADSC Quantum 210r CCD detector at NW12A of Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan."
Initial phases were determined by molecular replacement method using the structure of the yeast 20S proteasome [1RYP] as a starting model and the structure model with a ligand was refined by using Refmac5 in CCP4 program package with an R value of 16.5% at 2.85  Aring .
The electron densities have been observed at the active site as mentioned above in the  beta -ring.
Binding site of compound-A is closed to Tyr170 and Thr1 of the  beta 5 subunit.
compound-A binds weakly to their residues by hydrogen bondings.
It is quite different from the binding mode of the known potent proteasome inhibitor bortezomib [2].
"We used native sulfur-SAD phasing to determine a novel structure of significant health importance, the flaviviruses non-structural protein 1 (NS1)."
Flaviviruses cause many diseases including dengue and West Nile fever.
NS1 functions in both genome replication and immune system evasion.
"Full length, glycosylated NS1 was expressed in insect cells and crystallized."
"Due to difficulties with protein expression SeMet phasing was not practical, and we embarked on an effort to use sulfur-SAD phasing."
"To optimize the probability of observing the estimated 1.5% S-anomalous signal, we used inverse beam protocol at 7.1 keV with 50 wedges and 0.50 oscillations."
Crystals typically diffracted to ~3.0  Aring .
Pairwise comparisons of anomalous correlation coefficient (AnomCC) and Rmerge in the highest intensity (low resolution) bins were used to decide which crystals to include in the final data set.
"Crystals which when compared to other crystals consistently had AnomCC  lt  0, or Rmerge  gt  7.5% in the low resolution bin were excluded."
Data from 18 of 28 crystals were combined to generate a data set with ~100 fold anomalous multiplicity.
The final data set was of high quality by I/
sigma I and CC1/2 metrics with a positive AnomCC to ~5.4  Aring .
Sulfur sites were found with SHELXD using data to 5.2  Aring .  
Phases calculated to 4.5  Aring  by SHELXE and extended to 3.0  Aring  with DM were of sufficient quality to autobuild ~75% of the final model.
"The NS1 structure was complete with the exception of one 20-residue internal loop, and glycosylation was observed at expected sites."
"Although Rmerge values were high for the combined data (30% overall, 9% low-res, 900% hi-res), model building and refinement proceeded smoothly, supporting the notion that Rmerge is a poor indicator of data quality for purposes of refinement and may also be a poor indicator for purposes of phasing."
"The effects of data multiplicity and resolution on S-site determination, phase calculation and phase extension were investigated."
"N-salicylideneaniline derivatives are known to show photochromism by UV light, and it depends on the molecular conformation in the crystal.  "
"The twisted molecule is photochromic but the planar one is not[1,2]."
"(2SAP) always has a planar conformation due to the chemical structure without steric hindrance, therefore 2SAP is known as non-photochromic."
"However, by confining the molecule in a cavity of the macrocyclic boronic ester 1[3], the conformation and photochromism can be controlled."
The inclusion crystal of 1 (homo-parallel form) has a special feature to have a channel type crystal structure in which the macrocyclic ring aligned one-dimensionally to include guest molecules.
"Interestingly, the crystals can reversibly absorb/desorb guests maintaining the crystal structure, because the channel structure is robust.  "
"To exchange the included guests, the crystal of 1(homo-parallel form) was immersed in the melt of 2SAP at 90 deg C."
The obtained inclusion crystal showed photochromism.
"In the crystal structure, the shape of residual electron density for 2SAP indicated the conformation of 2SAP was twisted due to the confining in the cavity, which is the reason for photochromism.  "
"On the other hand, the recrystallization of 1 and 2SAP from THF / hexane solution unexpectedly gave hetero-antiparallel form of 1 because of the dynamic covalent bond formation in the boronic esters (Fig.)."
"As this hetero-antiparallel form has planar cavity in the molecule, the conformation of the included guest molecule, 2SAP, is also planar as always seen."
Therefore the inclusion crystal is non-photochromic.  
"Thus, photochromism change of 2SAP was realized by conformational control through confining in the cavity of macrocyclic boronic ester."
Sphingobium sp.
SYK-6 grows on a lignin-related biphenyl compound as the sole carbon and energy source and was initially isolated from a pond waste liquor from a kraft pulp mill.
"In SYK-6, 5-CH3-H4folate is synthesized from aromatic compounds such as a vanillate by a O-demethylase, LigM."
"then converted to 5,10-CH2-H4folate, which is utilized for syntheses of DNA, repair DNA, and methylate DNA as well as to act as a cofactor in certain biological reactions, by another enzyme, MetF."
"In other bacterial speceis, 5,10-CH2-H4folate is directly synthesized by T- and H-proteins that are enzymes in Glycine Cleavage System."
"It is considered that SYK-6 has evolved to acquire this unique pathway for the 5,10-CH2-H4folate production, in order to survive in extreme environmental condition."
"To elucidate the molecular mechanisim of this pathway, we have carried out the structural analysis of LigM. LigM was purified by using IMPACT system provided from NEB, which use intein and affinity chitin-binding tag."
"After crystallization screening, a reservoir solution of 0.2 M Mg acetate, 0.1 M Acetate buffer pH 4.6, and 20 %(w/v) PEG8000 gave a needle crystals with approximate dimensions of 0.3 times 0.1 times 0.01 mm3."
A diffraction data set was collected with 1.1  Aring  wavelength at BL1-A in the Photon Factory.
"However, phasing trials via molecular replacement (using a model with 19% sequence identity) failed."
"Because LigM is a 53 kDa protein and contains fourteen sulfur atoms, LigM is an interesting candidate for SAD phasing with sulfur (S-SAD)."
"Diffraction data sets of LigM crystals were collected with 1.9 and 2.7  Aring  wavelengths, reaching a maximum resolution of 2.3 Aring ."
Preliminary results are promising for solving the phase problem via S-SAD.
This study is also of methodological interest as the phasing capability of two different wavelengths can be compared.
A thorough analysis of the diffraction data is in progress.
Carbamazepine form
"I, CBZ, and 4-hydroxy-N-phenylbenzenesulfonamide, HPS, both exhibit highly anisotropic needle-like crystal growth."
CBZ has been observed to have a corresponding anisotropy in its dissolution.
"Using the assumption that crystal growth and dissolution have reciprocal mechanisms[1] molecular dynamics, MD, simulations of CBZ and HPS crystal dissolution have been used to examine the mechanism of the needle growth/dissolution."
MD simulations of CBZ dissolution using AMBER[2] reproduce the highly anisotropic crystal dissolution.
Blocks containing between 48 and 256 molecules in 50 to 90  Aring 3 boxes of solvent show rapid loss of molecules from the a face.
Simulation of HPS crystal dissolution also shows high anisotropy however the dissolution of HPS is much slower than that of CBZ due to the presence of hydrogen bonding chains in the structure.
A two unit cell molecule centroid distance matrix analysis was used to detect molecular stacking in both structures.
The direction of the hydrogen bonding in HPS is normal to the direction of growth.
However the relatively rapid dissolution is in the stacking direction in both crystal structures and is attributed to the higher relative energy of surface molecules at the ends of the stacks that have a higher fraction of exposed atoms.
A related analysis has been applied to flat molecule structures which are stacked.
If flat molecule stacks can be compared to stacks of pizza boxes then the non-flat molecules described here can be compared to stacked chairs.
"Helium (He) is, on par with Neon, the most inert element in the Periodic Table."
"Indeed, no conclusive proofs about stable compounds containing chemical bonds with He at ambient conditions have been reported so far."
"However, pressure significantly affects chemical properties of elements."
"By using USPEX [1], a software which has been successfully used in the past to predict unexpected high pressure crystal structure [1], we found that above 160 GPa He and Sodium exothermically combine to form the compound"
Quasiharmonic free energy calculations based on computed phonon spectra indicate that the free energy of formation of Na2He is negative and that the latter is barely affected by the temperature (0-800 K range was considered).
"In order to understand the cause of stability of Na2He, we carried out a thorough study of its electronic structure at various pressures by means of several different approaches including the examination of the band structure and the analysis of real-space descriptors such as the electron density in the framework of the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules [2], the Electron Localization Function [3] and the deformation density."
"By examining the band structure, we found that such compound is an insulator whose band-gap increases with pressure."
"Regarding real-space descriptors, two remarkable features of Na2He are the negative charge on He (obtained both using Mulliken and Bader partitioning) and the presence of interstitially localized electrons (i.e. Non-Nuclear Attractors), the latter being detectable in all the analyses above mentioned."
"In the range 160-350 GPa, the exothermicity associated to the formation of Na2He is mainly due to the volume reduction, while at higher pressures the electronic energy plays a prominent role in the stabilization of this compound."
In this contribution we present the results of our study with particular emphasis on the role played by He in the stabilization of Na2He.
"Conformational mobility is essential to many protein functions and design of therapies for a broad spectrum of human diseases depends on a deep understanding the linkage between protein structure, intramolecular motions and function.  "
Methods for screening small molecules and mutations that alter fluctuations are essential for improved understanding of this linkage.  
To what extent do changes in intramolecular motions lead to changes in function
"To address this question, we are using a combination of wide-angle x-ray solution scattering (WAXS) and molecular dynamics (MD) to generate novel insights into the magnitude, form and functional consequences of intramolecular motions of proteins in solution."
WAXS has proven unexpectedly sensitive to the intramolecular motions of proteins in solution and can detect changes in flexibility generated by single amino acid replacements or binding of small molecule ligands.  
Here we formulate the effect of structural fluctuations on WAXS data in such a way as to make possible direct experimental assessment of the range of motion that proteins explore in solution.  
"The approach differs from other strategies by treating it as an inverse source problem, deriving flexibility parameters directly from data rather than from an ensemble of structures generated to predict the data."
"Dihydroxyacetone (Dha), also known as glycerone, is a metabolically active carbohydrate."
Dha kinase (DAK) is highly conserved enzyme that utilizes mainly Dha as substrate.
"In bacteria, DAK converts dihydroxyacetone to dihydroxyacetone phosphate in the glycerol fermentation pathway."
"In higher eukaryotes, DAK can accomplish two enzymatic activities, namely, ATP-dependent dihydroxyacetone phosphorylation and FMN cyclization.   "
The biological significance of cFMN is still not identified.
"Possible speculations of the functions are as signaling molecule, minor redox flavocoenzyme or intermediate of a degradative pathway for FAD."
"In order to understand the mechanisms of the FMN cyclizing reaction, we here present the crystal structures of hDAK soaked with FAD and its apo state."
The crystals are diffracted up to 2.0  Aring  in space group C2 with a dimer in each asymmetric unit.
"hDAK contains 2 domains: L domain and K domain, joined together by a linker region."
"In the FAD and Mn2+ soaked DAK structure, AMP is seen on K domain."
"The second cyclization product, cFMN, however is diffused during soaking and cannot be seen in the density map.   "
Mammalian DAK is also shown to be a negative regulator of MDA5.
MDA5 is a cytoplasmic protein that has important role in viral RNA detection and initiate innate immune response.
"Specifically, MDA5 undergoes conformational change upon viral RNA binding and allows its N terminal CARD domain to expose and bind to the CARD domain of the downstream signaling protein IPS-1."
IPS-1 is essential for the activation of proinflammatory cytokines and type 1 interferon.
Pulldown assays indicated that MDA5 CARD domain is responsible for the interaction of IPS-1 CARD as well as hDAK.
The competition and the exact mechanisms are still unknown.
We shall apply biophysical techniques such as ITC and SPR to quantify the binding parameters.
"Last but not least, to crystallize the complex in order to provide a clear molecular detail of the interaction between MDA5 and its binding partners."
The differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells to osteoblasts is one of the critical steps of bone formation.
"Osterix (Osx) is an osteoblast-specific transcriptional factor required for bone formation and osteoblast differentiation, which has been shown to interact with other factors to control the expression of osteoblast-specific genes."
"A novel JmjC domain containing protein NO66 has been identified in the regulation network of Osx, which plays an important role in osteoblast differentiation through interaction with Osx."
"Here we report the crystal structure of NO66, showing it exists as a functional tetramer form."
A hinge domain links N-terminal JmjC domain and C-terminal wHTH domain of NO66 and is essential for its tetrameric assembly.
"The oligomerization interface of NO66 provides the binding site for Osx, which interacts with a conserved fragment of Osx."
Further work demonstrates that the hinge domain-dependent oligomerization is essential for NO66 to interact with Osx and controls Osx-dependent gene expression.
Our finding reveals that homo-oligomerization of JmjC domain containing proteins plays a critical role in interaction with regulatory factors and may have significant physiological roles.
"The soil bacterium, Pseudomonas putida, is capable of using the alicyclic compound quinate as a sole carbon source.  "
"During this process, quinate is converted to 3-dehydroshikimate, which subsequently undergoes a dehydration to form protocatechuate.  "
The latter transformation is performed by the enzyme dehydroshikimate dehydratase (DSD).  
We have recombinantly produced DSD from P. putida and are currently performing x-ray crystallographic studies on the enzyme to gain structural insight into its catalytic mechanism and mode of substrate recognition.   
"Initial crystals of DSD diffracted to 2.7  Auml  resolution, but exhibited strong twinning.  "
"A redesigned construct has recently yielded crystals that diffract to similar resolution, but with a significantly reduced tendency toward twinning.  "
"Interestingly, sequence analysis of P. putida DSD reveals that the protein is in fact a fusion of two distinct domains: an N-terminal sugar phosphate isomerase-like domain associated with DSD activity, and a C-terminal hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD)-like domain with unknown functional significance.  "
Structural characterization of the protein may provide novel insight into the functional relevance of the unusual HPPD-like domain.
Radiation damage is a limiting factor in macromolecular X-ray crystallography diffraction experiments.
"Global damage leads to a unit cell size increase and non-isomorphism, and to a loss of long range crystal order which is visible in the decay of the diffraction pattern and loss of high resolution information during data collection."
"Specific damage causes detectable changes at particularly susceptible sites in the protein structure [1,2], such as the reduction of metallo-centres, elongation and subsequent breaking of disulphide bonds and decarboxylation of aspartate and glutamate residues."
"Between and within these groups the decay does not happen uniformly at equal rates throughout the protein, leading to preferential specific damage."
Specific damage can result in misleading biological conclusions on protein mechanism and function being drawn.  
"We have defined a new atom-specific metric, BDamage, which facilitates the identification of protein regions susceptible to specific radiation damage as well as the quantification of the susceptibility, allowing further investigations into preferential specific damage."
BDamage has been validated using a paired set of low-dose/high-dose protein structures [3].
Results show that BDamage successfully separates susceptible residues from stable parts of the protein.
A non-redundant subset of previously refined structures submitted to the PDB was then analyzed for indications of specific radiation damage.
"BDamage indicates that the distribution of specific damage is independent of secondary protein structure or disulphide bond configuration, but shows a correlation with solvent accessibility."
Results indicate a possible use of BDamage as a quality control metric for structure submission.
"Further research into an alternative quantification of real-space specific radiation damage, using the decay of electron density over multiple datasets, is outlined."
A challenge in X-ray topo-tomography is the issue of quantitatively determining the 3D-deformation-distribution field associated with single defects of crystal lattices.
In the present report an endeavor is made to retrieve a 3D-deformation-distribution field around single line defects (dislocations) in crystals by using the X-ray topo-tomography method.
The general layout of the X-ray topo-tomography experiment is depicted in Fig.
"For our purposes we have used plane-parallel samples of crystal Si with surface orientation (111), the sample thickness being 1 mm, in which the linear dislocations have been inserted according to [2]."
The experiments were carried out at the X-ray wavelength of MoK alpha 1 ( lambda =0.071 nm).
"Experimental series of the X-ray (2  macr 20)-reflection topography images with the rotation angle step 20 around the diffraction vector, the total angular range 3600, have been got out."
"Furthermore, such the 2D- topographic images are used for getting 3D-images by means of the modified algebraic method SART developed in [3]."
"In parallel, for 3D reconstruction the corresponding 2D-topographic dislocation images are simulated by use of the Born-approximation analytical and numerical solutions based on Takagi-Taupin equations describing the two-beam X-ray diffraction by the deformed crystals."
"Certainly, all the above approaches are applied to the comparative analysis of opportunities of determining 3D-deformation-distribution field around the dislocations under consideration.   "
The ultimate test of any crystallization experiment is how well the crystals (if any) diffract x-rays.  
"In particular, we would like this diffraction data to be as free from caveats as possible, so that we know one condition really does produce better crystals than another, and not that we had a great crystal somewhere, but it was messed up in the harvesting and cryo-preservation process.  "
The reason is because of background.  
"The principle impediment to observing weak high-resolution spots is that they get lost in the background scattering, so every effort must be made to minimize it.  "
"Unfortunately, plastic, water, oil, amorphous protein and protein crystal all generate a similar number of background x-rays per unit thickness.  "
"This is because they are all made of similarly light elements (oxygen, carbon, nitrogen) and have similar densities (0.9 to 1.2 g/cm^3).  "
"There is no such thing as a low background material, and everything the main beam touches on its way in, through and out of whatever is holding the crystal generates background.  "
"This is why loop mounts are so popular: the total path of the x-rays through non-crystalline stuff in a typical loop mount is generally not much thicker than the crystal, and reducing this thickness further has diminishing returns because the background is now dominated by that from disorder in the crystal lattice itself.  "
"So, why not make ultra-thin in-situ trays"
"Not only are thin walls difficult to manufacture cheaply, but they also dry out a lot faster, which is problematic for growing the crystals in the first place.  "
"The future success of in-situ diffraction requires trays that are not only thin-walled and low-permeability, but cheap.  "
Iron vanadates and phosphates have been widely explored [1-2] as possible electrode material for Li-ion batteries.
"In the goal of finding new materials, our approach was to consider existing materials and to investigate the flexibility of their network for possible substitutions."
"Among the different materials containing iron and vanadium, Cu3Fe4(XO4)6 (X = P, V) are isostructural to Fe7(PO4)6."
"[3] discussed the structural relationships between  beta -Cu3Fe4(VO4)6 and several other vanadates, phosphates and molybdates of general formula AxBy(VO4)6."
"The interesting network flexibility was then demonstrated with the existence of four different crystallographic sites, which can be partially occupied depending on the x+y value : x+y = 7 for  beta -Cu3Fe4(VO4)6) and x+y = 8 for NaCuFe2(VO4)3."
The LixFey(VO4)6 phase was then prepared considering the substitution of Li+ and Fe3+ for Cu2+ ions in  beta -Cu3Fe4(VO4)6 and the existence of an extra site to accommodate the charge compensation (7  le  x+y  le  8).
"As expected, a new lithium iron vanadate, isotructural to mineral Howardevansite was then obtained."
Single crystal diffraction data were collected at room temperature on Enraf-Nonius CAD-4 diffractometer.
Structure was refined with JANA-2006 program package.
"M ouml ssbauer and magnetic measurements were also used to check the oxidation state of iron ions, to support the obtained crystal structure and to consider any possible structural/magnetic transitions."
All the results will be presented and discussed in this presentation.
Paroxetine (PRX) is an antidepressant widely used in depression treatment for decades.
The anhydrous and hemidrate chloride forms have been used in pharmaceutical formulations.
During their developing a discussion associated with its physical forms and the complex hydration/dehydration behavior involving these phases were established.
"To improve our understanding of this issue we investigate the crystal structure of paroxetine bromide hemidrate, (PRX+.Br-).H2O, as a model for understanding the stability anhydrous/hemihydrate paroxetine arrangements and the nature of the intermolecular interaction of water within the crystal lattice by single crystal X-ray diffraction experiments."
"A combination of complementary characterization techniques were also used including Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Hot Stage microscopy and solubility measurements."
"As expected the paroxetine bromide hemidrate, (PRX+.Br-).H2O, is isostructural with the paroxetine chloride hemidrate, (PRX+.Cl-).H2O."
"As in that case, the crystal packing of (PRX+.Br-).H2O is stabilized by strong NH2+..."
Br hydrogen bonds which forms infinite channels along the b axis.
The water and bromide anions are located along these channels.
"The DSC/TGA analysis for (PRX+.Br-).H2O show an endothermic desolvation process with an onset temperature of 77.09  deg C, that is not present in the paroxetine chloride hemidrate DSC curve."
This process leaves to a paroxetine anhydrous bromide crystal structure that is isomorphic to the anhydrous chloride one.
"However, this structure is spontaneously rehydrated at ambient atmosphere."
"This rehydration phenomenon probe the stability of paroxetine hemihydrate arrangement, since (PRX+.Br-) is slightly more soluble that its hydrate form."
"As opposed to chloride hemidrate, the rehydration of paroxetine bromide only involves a rearrangement of the water molecule within the cavities."
Industrial catalysis utilizes mainly  mu m to mm-sized catalyst particles in catalytic reactors instead of powders since this minimizes problems associated with for example back pressure and clogging.
"In recent times, efforts have been made to study and characterize these `real life' single particles so as to determine the nature of chemical species present in 2D and 3D during various stages of the catalyst lifetime such as preparation, reaction and deactivation."
Traditionally this sort of analysis is performed on ex situ samples using invasive approaches which often interfere with the chemical process under study and the subsequent conclusions that can be drawn.
"As a result there has been a recent move towards studying these processes non-invasively and where possible, dynamically in order to understand in detail how the chemistry evolves within catalyst particles and how this and the spatial distribution of the various chemical components influence catalytic behaviour."
"For this purpose we have developed synchrotron-based X-ray Computed Tomography imaging techniques for studying catalytic solids in real time in order to examine how the active phases form, how they behave under reaction conditions and why they eventually deactivate."
"The Canadian Macromolecular Crystallography Facility (CMCF) operates two crystallography beamlines, 08ID-1 and 08B1-1 (http://cmcf.lightsource.ca), at the Canadian Light Source (CLS)."
Normal access is through a traditional peer review process but commercial access is also welcome.
Users apply for beamtime against their active proposals and may collect data in person or via remote access (Remote Control or Mail-In).  
Remote Control allows users to control the beamlines remotely from home institutions.
"Additionally, users with the highest peer review scores have the option of Mail-In beamtime, where data are collected by CMCF staff according to investigators' instructions."
This method has proven very effective for several reasons.
"Data are collected by trained personnel experienced with the beamlines, resulting in high quality data."
Travel expenses are eliminated.
"Data are collected around regular user shifts using the most appropriate beamline, reducing wasted beamtime and providing flexibility."
"The process is made extremely efficient when integrated with MxLIVE, the CMCF Laboratory Information Management System, since images can be viewed and output files downloaded almost immediately after data have been collected for the user.  "
Four Mail-In shifts per week are typically supported during normal operations.
"In 2013 alone, over 430 datasets were collected for more than 20 investigators across Canada."
"At least 12 peer-reviewed articles appeared in 2013 containing Mail-In data, many in high-impact journals."
Several of these results will be discussed.
"In addition to the development of new energy-producing processes, finding new energy-saving procedures offers a promising solution to meet our energy needs in the long run."
"Indeed, cheap organometallic precursors for oxide materials and catalysis are key technologies for energy saving."
"A wide variety of metal alkoxides/aryloxides[1] has been used not only as precursors for oxide materials, but also as initiators and catalysts for ring-opening polymerization (ROP)."
"Ceramic oxide materials are widely used for many applications, exceptionally in lithium-ion batteries (LIB) material for the last for these recent decades."
"Also, due to the use of cyclic esters in the tailoring synthesis of biodegradable and bioresorbable materials, interest in the development of well-defined initiators and catalysts has increased."
"For both cited reasons, iron-based aryloxide complexes offer many advantages, such as the large abundance of iron, their low toxicity and even their biocompatibility[1]."
"Aryloxide/alkoxide complexes have been also proposed like good route precursors due to their high solubility, low decomposition temperatures, cross linking ability, ease of modification and commercial availability[2]."
"In the last decades, the confinement of various types of functional material in mesoporous silica matrices has been used to design hybrid organic-inorganic nanocomposites with unique and fascinating properties."
"Such nanocomposites have attracted considerable interest owing to their potential applications in various domains [1-2], while reports with precise structural information of such molecular nanomaterials are still rather scarce and quite disparate."
"However, in order to be able to derive a structure-functionality relationship of such hybrid complexes, a detailed description of the structural organisation of the guest species and of their immediate surrounding is absolutely mandatory.  "
We show in this contribution that detailed structural information can be obtained by using an appropriate multiscale approach combining various experimental techniques such as X-ray total scattering coupled to atomic pair distribution function (PDF) and solid-state NMR spectroscopy.
This multiscale approach does provide more extensive and accurate structural information [3].
The PDF approach has allowed the identification of the nature of the incorporated species and their arrangement as well as the distinction of the various existing phases: isolated molecules and nanoparticles.
The multi-nuclei Solid State NMR investigation has provided information on both the amorphous host and the molecular guest and adds a dynamic dimension to the classical static structural characterisation.
We also discuss the influence of the structural changes on the physical properties of the investigated materials
"The term emphanisis [1] has been coined to define the appearance of local off-centering displacements of ions from a high-symmetry ground state on warming, as recently discovered in PbTe [2].  "
"Such a phenomenon is unusual because, in the canonical view of structural transformations, a low-symmetry ground state evolves into a higher symmetry state on warming."
"Although it is not uncommon for remnants of a low-symmetry phase to appear as spatial fluctuations at high temperature, the emergence of a locally broken symmetry state from a high symmetry ground state is quite rare."
"Emphanisis may be behind some long-known, but poorly understood anomalies seen in the lead chalcogenides."
"However, the origin and nature of emphanisis are still the subject of controversy.  "
"Several explanations for emphanisis have been suggested, including a simple response to an underlying anharmonic potential [3], a dynamic ferroelectric-like off-centering [2], and a temperature-dependent competition between ionicity and covalency [1], but an understanding remains elusive.  "
"In this talk I will report on atomic pair distribution function (PDF) measurements of the lead-free compound SnTe, which is isostructural to PbTe at high T but with a ferroelectric phase below Tc ~"
"100K. Our data show that SnTe also exhibits an emphanitic response, but with an  onset temperature well above Tc and a symmetry that is distinct from that of the ferroelectric phase."
Taken together these results suggests that the emphanitic and ferroelectric responses are quite distinct.
Pincer complexes have been a major focus in organometallic chemistry over the past four decades due to their important potential in catalysis and materials science.
"In the case of pincer complexes of d8 metals, a growing number of charge-neutral and cationic derivatives featuring hydrides, alkyls, and other reactive moieties have been shown to catalyze important transformations."
"Regarding the mechanisms of these catalytic reactions, an important issue that remains unresolved concerns the type of intermediates formed upon substrate uptake, namely:  A: Do substrates displace one or more hemi-labile donor moieties of the pincer ligand?"
Or  B
Does the substrate occupy a fifth coordination site while the pincer ligand remains intact                                                                                               
"In this presentation, Xray crystallography is used to describe the influence of the substitue on the 18-electron species based on POCN-Ni precursors."
These new diamagnetic complexes are proposed as models for the intermediates that might be involved in catalytic reactions promoted by this family of complexes                                                              (Scheme 2).
14-3-3 proteins are a highly conserved family of dimeric phospho-serine binding proteins that modulate the functions of key cellular proteins involved in signaling.
"14-3-3 zeta  plays a prominent role in signaling pathways leading to inhibition of apoptosis, sequestration of tumor suppressor proteins and activation of signalling pathways that promote growth."
14-3-3 zeta  expression is up-regulated in many human cancers and associated with enhanced survival of cancer cells.
The significant association of 14-3-3 zeta  over expression with disease recurrence and chemo-resistance makes this protein an attractive candidate for anti-cancer therapy.
The anti-apoptotic activity of 14-3-3 zeta  is entirely dependent on the dimeric state of the protein.
"Our studies have shown that 14-3-3 zeta  activity is regulated by sphingosine and other lipid analogs that render 14-3-3 phosphorylatable, disrupting its dimeric state thereby leading to apoptosis [1]."
Structural studies and mutagenesis on 14-3-3 zeta  confirm that the dimeric state of 14-3-3 zeta  is stabilized by salt bridges that form across the dimer interface.
Based on this we have carried out an in silico screen of a virtual library of drug-like small molecules to identify compounds that bind to the dimer interface of 14-3-3 zeta .
Candidate small molecules have been assessed for their ability to render 14-3-3 zeta  phosphorylatable in vitro and consequently we have identified a family of small molecules with 14-3-3 zeta  dimer-destabilizing properties.
These small molecules induce apoptosis in leukemic cells by activating apoptotic mediators known to be regulated by dimeric 14-3-3.
We have recently solved the crystal structure of 14-3-3 zeta  with one of our hit compounds bound at the dimer interface.
"Our results suggest that relatively small perturbations at the dimer interface, can destabilize the salt bridges that hold 14-3-3 dimers together, thus providing a novel approach to targeting 14-3-3 proteins for therapeutic benefit."
"Hydrogen has been considered as a promising alternative fuel for transportation, provided we can find a way to store a large amount of hydrogen in a compact way.  "
"The realization of such a storage system can be achieved by developing materials that can easily absorb, safely store, and rapidly release hydrogen repeatedly.  "
"However, there is currently no material to meet all the requirements for on board storage.  "
Great efforts have been made to understand hydrogenation properties of currently available materials to look for a way to improve properties or to prepare new materials.  
"However, investigating the structure of some of these materials is challenging since their hydrides are only available under hydrogen gas pressure.  "
"Furthermore, many novel materials with improved properties often show heavily disordered or nanoscale structural features which are difficult to characterize using conventional crystallographic technique alone (crystallographically challenged hydrogen storage materials).       "
In order to investigate the structural change in crystallographically challenged hydrogen storage materials during hydrogenation or dehydrogenation processes we have developed in-situ hydrogen gas loading setup for synchrotron X-ray total scattering experiments at the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) beamline of BL22XU [1] at SPring-8.  
"Coupled to an area detector [1,2], this setup allows us to obtain the atomic pair distribution function (PDF) [3] of metal hydrides either in equilibrium or in non-equilibrium state with hydrogen.  "
"In this poster, we will introduce our in-situ setup and present some preliminary results on AB5-type intermetallic compounds and Pd nanoparticles."
Molecular hydrogen (H2) has been proposed as an alternative fuel source for vehicles.
"Though H2 has many benefits, such as clean combustion and the highest known energy density by mass, there are issues in how to store it in a safe and cost effective way."
"One solution is to store hydrogen in a chemical compound, and gas clathrates (crystalline inclusion compounds) have shown promising results.  "
Pressure provides a powerful means to tune the properties of such compounds and its effects on potential hydrogen storage materials are widely explored.   
"We have recently developed a hydrogen-compatible gas loader for the Paris-Edinburgh press, which enables the loading of high density hydrogen into a clamp with a sample volume suitable for neutron diffraction experiments using the Paris-Edinburgh press [1]."
Neutron diffraction is the technique of choice for such materials since it can reveal the location and occupancy of the hydrogen sites.
We will present recent data from high-pressure neutron diffraction experiments on hydrogen hydrates as well as other clathrate forming systems like urea and hydroquinone.
Helicobacter pylori infection causes a variety of gastrointestinal diseases including peptic ulcers and gastric cancer.
The colonization of this bacterium in the gastric mucosa is required for the survival in the stomach.
"Its colonization of the gastric mucosa of human stomach depends on its motility, which is facilitated by the helical cell shape."
"In H. pylori, crosslinking relaxation or trimming of peptidoglycan muropeptide affects the helical shape."
"Among several cell shape-determining peptidoglycan hydrolases identified in H. pylori, Csd4 is a Zn2+-dependent D,L-carboxypeptidase that cleaves the bond between the  gamma -D-Glu and mDAP bond of the uncrosslinked tripeptide of peptidoglycan"
"(L-Ala- gamma -D-Glu-mDAP) to produce L-Ala- gamma -D-Glu dipeptide and mDAP, promoting the helical cell shape."
"Inhibition of D,L-carboxypeptidase activity of Csd4 may represent a novel therapeutic approach."
"We report here the crystal structures of H. pylori Csd4 in three different states: the ligand-free form, the substrate-bound form, and the product-bound form."
"H. pylori Csd4 consists of three domains: an N-terminal D,L-carboxypeptidase domain, a novel  beta -barrel domain, and a C-terminal immunoglobulin-like domain."
"Our ligand-bound structures provide structural basis of peptidoglycan recognition by D,L-carboxypeptidase."
H. pylori Csd4 recognizes primarily the terminal mDAP of the tripeptide substrate and undergoes a significant structural change upon binding either mDAP or mDAP-containing tripeptide.
"The development of transition metal oxides with perovskite-based structure has stimulated the search for mixed anion systems such as oxynitrides, oxyhalides and oxysulfides because incorporation of two different anions in one structure offers further opportunity to effectively induce chemical and physical properties that the pure oxides cannot possess."
"Such mixed anion phases, however, are difficult to be synthesized by a conventional high-temperature reaction."
"In this study, we have employed a high pressure technique to overcome this issue, and succeessfully synthesized a series of new layered oxhalide compounds."
"We present structural and magnetic properties of high-valent nickel oxyhalides Sr2NiO3X (X = F, Cl), and square-planar coordinated oxychlorides Sr2MO2Cl2 (Mn, Ni) and Ba2PdO2Cl2, isostructural with superconducting parent compund Ca2CuO2Cl2."
"Because both RNA and DNA carry large negative charge, interaction with oppositely charged partners is required for folding to functional structures.  "
"For example, counterions fold RNA and condense DNA."
"Despite these important roles, ion detection remains elusive."
I describe the application of anomalous SAXS methods that highlight the contribution to the scattering signal arising from counterions [1].  
"In addition to measuring ion distribution, we also count the number of excess ions surrounding a nucleic acid structure [2,3]."
"Taken together, measurements of ion number and spatial distribution provide an understanding of the relationship between counterions and nucleic acid structure.  "
Present ASAXS work in the Pollack lab is supported by the NIH through grants R01 GM085062 and R01 GM099450.
"Despite the key implications carbohydrates have in a multitude of pathological processes, a large number of the sugar-containing structures deposited into the Protein Data Bank (PDB) show nomenclature errors"
1] that persist even after the remediation of the PDB archive [2].
Here we present the results from a systematic study of the conformation and ring distortion of cyclic carbohydrate models for which structure factors have been deposited into the PDB.
These models have also been scored using a real-space correlation coefficient calculated between model and experimental electron density.
"The results have enabled us to produce a database of well-refined carbohydrate structures for use in the framework of an automated sugar-detecting software, to be announced shortly."
In this work we present a method that will allow for the construction and enumeration of non-perfect colorings of symmetrical tilings.
"If G is the symmetry group of an uncolored symmetrical tiling, then a coloring of the symmetrical tiling is non-perfect if its associated color group is a proper subgroup of G."
The process will facilitate a systematic construction of non-perfect colorings of a wider class of symmetrical tilings where the stabilizer of a tile in the symmetry group G of the uncolored symmetrical tiling is non-trivial and the set of tiles may not form a transitive set under the action of G.
This poster discusses results on how to identify and characterize non-perfect colorings arising from the method with associated color groups of index 4.
"The approach obtained here provides an avenue to model and characterize various chemical structures with atoms of different proportions, and their symmetries."
"This is relevant particularly for understanding new and emerging structures, such as structural analogues of carbon nanotubes, where a lot of its physical and electronic properties depend on their symmetry."
"The constant progress in both X-ray source and detector technology has clearly led not only to faster data collection, but also to improvements in data quality."
"As we move towards the unattainable holy grail of error free diffraction data, it is possible to address ever more subtle questions concerning the electron density distribution and associated properties."
"Current applications to the study of weak interactions, core polarization, heavy element compounds, anharmonic atomic displacements, and anisotropic motion of hydrogen atoms will be presented."
The reliability of these studies will be discussed based on evaluations of data quality and refinement statistics.
All compounds that contain malonate dianions C3H2O42- (mal2-) and atoms of d- or f-metals were analyzed.
Dianions mal2- in structures of examined compounds reveal 17 topological types of coordination against metal atoms.
Available data shows that mal2- more often form six-membered metal cycles which is the most abundant case for all 570 crystallographic sorts of analyzed mal2- (80%).
For those mal2- which form six-membered metal cycles the average observed valence angle SSS is equal to 1200.
Results of regression analysis of all mal2- showed linear dependence of  ang SSS on dihedral angel ( phiv ) between planes which go through oxygen and carbon atoms of different carboxyl groups of one anion.

Structural slackness of mal2- influence on characteristics of six-membered metal cycles formed by them.
Those metal cycles usually have bath conformation.
Coordination polymers with fixed type of metal atom and identical type of coordination of mal2- can have different dimension even in the absence of other linkers.
This effect is evident on the example of [UO2(mal)(L)
middot nH2O compounds.
"Reportedly [1], change of composition and structure of ligand L lead to changes in the system of intramolecular hydrogen bonds which influence on conformation of six-membered metal cycles."
"The change of conformation of this cycles lead to different relative spatial distribution of the three uranium atoms, connected with one mal2-."
"Although of the same stoichiometric composition and crystallochemical role of uranium atoms and coordinated ligand resulting polymeric groups [UO2(mal)(L)] in crystals have different dimension: 3D, 2D or 1D respectively for L  ndash  carbamide, water or dimethylacetamide."

"Addition of nanoparticles into rubber is indispensable process for production of rubbery materials, as it improves the viscoelastic and mechanical properties of rubber (reinforcement effect)."
"However, the understanding of reinforcement effect is far from satisfactory in spite of many studies."
Further microscopic-scale investigation is required for controlling and improving the properties of rubbery materials.  
"Aiming to construct a microscopic model of filled rubber under elongation, we have investigated nanoparticle dynamics in uniaxially stretched rubber using heterodyne X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (heterodyne XPCS)[1] at BL03XU, SPring-8, Japan."
"In heterodyne XPCS, information on the fluctuating and dissipative dynamics of nanoparticles and that on their advective motion are separately extracted from the time correlation of X-ray scattering intensity.  "
The results of heterodyne XPCS experiments showed that the direction of nanoparticles' advective motion corresponds to the macroscopic deformation of the sample in stress relaxation process.
"Furthermore, we found that chemical bond between nanoparticle and rubber polymer influences the dynamics of nanoparticles.  "
"In this presentation, we will show detailed analysis of the heterodyne XPCS results and discuss a microscopic description of filled rubber under elongation.  "
"This study was conducted under the approval of the SPring-8 Proposal Advisory Committee (2013A7210, 2013B7259)."
"Inorganic phosphate is an essential component of many biological molecules and processes including cellular signaling, generation of metabolic energy, DNA and RNA, and membrane phospholipids."
"Organophosphonates, which contain a highly stable carbon-phosphorus bond, are widely used as herbicidal, chelation, anti-scale, and medicinal agents."
PhnY and PhnZ consist of a new oxidative catabolic pathway that is employed by marine bacteria to use 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid as a source of inorganic phosphate.
"PhnZ is notable for catalyzing the oxidative cleavage of a carbon-phosphorus bond using Fe(II) and dioxygen (see figure), despite belonging to a large family of hydrolytic enzymes, the HD-phosphohydrolase superfamily."
"We have determined structures of PhnZ in complex with its substrate, (R)-2-amino-1-hydroxyethylphosphonate."
"The structure reveals PhnZ to have an active site containing two Fe ions bound by 4 histidines and 2 aspartates (see figure) that is strikingly similar to the carbon-carbon bond cleaving enzyme, myo-inositol-oxygenase."
Site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic analysis with substrate analogues revealed the roles of key active site residues.
A 5th histidine that is conserved in the PhnZ subfamily specifically interacts with the substrate 1-hydroxyl.
"The structure also revealed that PhnZ possesses a unique induced-fit mechanism whereby an active-site aspartate specifically recognizes the 2-amino group of the substrate and toggles the release of an aromatic residue from the active site, thereby creating space for molecular oxygen bind to the second Fe ion."
"Structural comparisons of PhnZ reveal an evolutionary connection between Fe(II)-dependent hydrolysis of phosphate esters and oxidative carbon-phosphorus or carbon-carbon bond cleavage, thus uniting the diverse chemistries that are found in the HD superfamily."
"Following the United Nations General Assembly (Decision A/66/L.51) declaration of 2014 as the International Year of Crystallography (IYCr2014), UNESCO and IUCr received a strong mandate to coordinate the activities of the Year in order to tackle the global disaffection from science and scientific careers, namely in crystallography, that threatens scientific enterprise innovation and sustainability and, consequently, the prospects for using science for development, especially in Africa.  "
"For developing countries in Africa, it is therefore vital to be in a position to exploit the opportunities that crystallography and the IYCr2014 offer in terms of building, nurturing and maintaining a critical mass of highly qualified, innovative scientists, students and engineers in crystallography-related fields.  "
"For all those reasons, UNESCO seizes the opportunities presented by the International Year to foster crystallography education, research and cooperation and its use and applications, which are providing solutions to some of the developmental challenges that Africa is facing today."
"Some of the UNESCO/IUCr flagships initiatives echoing to this strategy are both the IUCr-UNESCO OpenLabs (a network of operational crystallographic laboratories) nbsp in Africa and the Regional Summit meeting in Bloemfontein, South Africa."
A method is described which provides phase estimates for structure factors.
The data required are the moduli of some or all of the structure factors and phases for a sub-set of them.
The Fourier components corresponding to a real square root of the electron density are estimated by fitting their self convolution to the available data by least squares.
The structure factors are modified to improve resolution and maintain non-negativity of the electron density.
Suitable weighting of the observations assists convergence and estimates of error for the electron density map are provided.
The results of tests of the method are described.
"This erratum is to apologise for having reported the crystallization and X-ray characterization of Bacillus pumilus acetylxylan esterase (AXE) while the protein crystallized was instead an inorganic pyrophosphatase, a contaminant of the expression in E. coli."
"The protein was purified by hydrophobic interaction, ionic exchange and gel filtration, but still contained traces of contaminant proteins."
Crystals were obtained in the R32 space group perfectly compatible with the homohexameric structure of AXE.
The cell parameters were compatible with a reasonable crystal packing as in the model cephalosporin C deacetylase from Bacillus subtilis kindly provided before publication by Dr Jim Brannigan et al.
PDB code 1ods crystallized in R3 and 1odt crystallized in R32).
"Since every attempt to solve the structure by molecular replacement using 1odt as a model failed, a search of the PDB using the cell parameters of the data collected revealed a match with Escherichia coli inorganic pyrophosphatase (1ipw)."
A molecular-replacement solution confirmed that the protein crystallized was indeed E. coli inorganic pyrophosphatase present as a contaminant in the protein preparation used for crystallization.
This experience should be kept in mind because proteins used for crystallization should be as pure as possible not only to favour the process itself but also to avoid the crystallization of contaminants.

"A31, 252-259] for deriving the sign of quartet relations is used to obtain formulae which take terms of order 1/N2 into account."
"Experimental tests show that the overall reliability of the quartets is better estimated by these formulae, but does not reach the reliability of the triplets."
Probabilistic formulae are then rescaled by suitable empirical factors.
The new expressions lead to an improvement compared both with theoretical formulae and with the empirical [Schenk (1975).

The molecular replacement method is a powerful technique for crystal structure solution but the use of NMR structures as templates often causes problems.
In this work the NMR structure of the p53 tetramerization domain has been used to solve the crystal structure by molecular replacement.

Crystals of the monomeric and dimeric forms of human neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin have been grown in hanging-drop vapor-diffusion trials using PEG as a precipitating agent with recombinant protein expressed in a baculovirus-based system.
Crystals of monomeric NGAL belong to the cubic space group P432 with lattice constants a = b = c = 126.6 emsp14  Aring ; crystals of dimeric NGAL belong to the tetragonal space group P41212 (or its enantiomorph P43212) with lattice constants a = b = 54.14 and c = 121.56 emsp14  Aring .

It is shown that there always exists a coordinate system in which components of property tensors that distinguish between the domains of a magnetic non-ferroelastic domain pair differ solely in the two domains by a change in sign.
"The 309 classes of twin laws of magnetic non-ferroelastic domain pairs are listed and the twin laws, which are given in a coordinate system where the tensor distinction is provided by a change in sign of tensor components, are specified."

"The data do not carry any morphological information, but they unambiguously show that the driving force of the gel formation is a thermodynamic instability of the polymerizing solution."
Designing potent selective kinase inhibitors is an ongoing challenge due to the high level of homology within the protein kinome.  
The AGC family comprises ~12% of the kinome and includes many important drug targets.  
"We compared the binding mode of two inhibitors within the catalytic domain of a set of AGC kinase family members: PKC related kinase (PRK), p90 ribosomal s6 kinase N terminal domain (RSKn), and protein kinase A (PKA).  "
"We observed that even within the closely related AGC kinase subfamily, the two ligands can bind in alternate orientations."
"Alternative binding modes can be attributed to specific sequence variations and structural differences, however the observation of multiple inhibitor binding modes within a subfamily highlights the difficulties in predicting the activity spectrum of kinase inhibitors.  "
"The crystal structures described herein may help in the design of potent, selective kinase inhibitors to these or related kinases."
For accurate synchrotron data collection it is important to know the precise X-ray wavelength and to be able to monitor this value.
Due to the high heat load on the X-ray optics from modern sources significant drifts may occur.
Any change in wavelength is reflected as a change in the unit cell parameters derived from the data and this is especially problematic for measurements of strain.
A conceptually simple device has been developed to allow measurements and monitoring of the X-ray wavelength by measuring the transmission of a silicon single crystal wafer in transmission.
As the crystal is rotated in the beam different hkl reflections are diffracted leading to a loss of intensity in the transmitted beam.
"By measuring the incident and transmitted intensity the angles of all of these peaks can be measured with high precision while rotating the crystal, with a setup rather similar to a conventional EXAFS experiment."
A similar device has also recently been developed for polychromatic experiments [1].
For high energy X-rays the wafer can be left in the beam throughout the experiment and individual reflections can be scanned to monitor the wavelength as a function of time.
The rich diffraction pattern which can be recorded in this geometry should contain a wealth of information as all single rocking curves are measured with high resolution on an absolute scale in comparison to the crystal absorption.  
The figure shows an example scan collected at 42 keV using a silicon wafer.
"Methylated cytosine of CpG dinucleotides in vertebrates may be oxidized by Tet proteins, a process that can lead to DNA demethylation."
"The predominant oxidation product, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), has been implicated in embryogenesis, cell differentiation and human diseases."
"Recently, the SRA domain of UHRF2 (UHRF2-SRA) has been reported to specifically recognize 5hmC, but how UHRF2 recognizes this modification is unclear."
Here we report the structure of UHRF2-SRA in complex with a 5hmC-containing DNA.
"The structure reveals that the conformation of a phenylalanine allows the formation of an optimal 5hmC-binding pocket, and a hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group of 5hmC and UHRF2-SRA is critical for their preferential binding."
"Further structural and biochemical analyses unveiled the role of SRA domains as a versatile reader of modified DNA, and the knowledge should facilitate further understanding of the biological function of UHRF2, and the comprehension of DNA hydroxymethylation in general."
"In eukaryotes, the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (CTD) orchestrates the temporal and spatial control of transcription and is involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression."
"Errors in CTD regulation can result in cell death, cancer and severe developmental defects."
The CTD executes its function as transcription modulator through various post-translational modifications on its heptad repeat sequences.  
"Recently, novel modifications on new regulatory sites of CTD have been identified, setting the stage for the possibility of combinatorial mechanisms for transcription regulation.  "
"We focused on two well-characterized modification of CTD, namely serine phosphorylation and prolyl isomerization, and discuss the interplay between the enzymes regulating these modification states.  "
"Our results established that the selectivity of prolyl isomerization state of CTD on phosphatases can lead to differentiated outcome for the CTD phosphorylation state and therefore, transcription.  "
"To further investigate the prolyl selectivity, we developed chemical compounds that can be used to probe such subtle structural variation in the CTD binding proteins."
These compounds closely mimic the cis or trans proline state and can be effectively recognized by CTD phosphatases.
The application of such chemical probes can help us understand the molecular mechanism of the interplay between phosphorylation and prolyl isomerization state and how that affect the conformational status of CTD in transcription temporally and spatially.

"The forensic analysis of evidences must be able to extract maximum of information from small quantities of samples, while preserving as much material as possible for future tests."
"In this case, the accuracy and speed are vital in order to obtain relevant and trustful results."
"Among the many types of materials that are subject of a criminal investigation, a great quantity of them can be analyzed by using the X-ray powder diffraction (XPD) technique"
"[2] [3]: inorganic, organic and metals."
"The huge advantages lie in the fact that it is a nondestructive technique and the unique characterization is possible because each compound has its own specific pattern, like a `fingerprint'."
It was not found any publication about the use of the XPD by the Brazilian laboratories that is dedicated to forensic analysis.
The aim of this work is to show the versatility of the technique and the great cost-beneficial that this technique can offer.  
Many Brazilian laboratories situated in universities possess the equipment and can eventually help the investigations along with the police.
"This partnership can provide advances in technology and can encourage the fundamental and applied science students to contribute with the Forensic Science in Brazil, increasing the quality and variety of the national scientific research."
According to Wikipedia scoliosis is a medical condition in which a person's spine is curved from side to side.
"Although it is a complex three-dimensional deformity, on an X-ray, viewed from the rear, the spine of an individual with scoliosis can resemble an `S' or a `?', rather than a straight line."
This definition fits very well with the syndrome observed in many structures of Z-DNA nucleotides.
"In contrast to the A- and B-forms of DNA, where the sugar-phosphate backbone smoothly follows the right-handed helical line, in Z-DNA the backbone winds as a left-handed zig-zag pattern, repeating every two base pairs."
On the basis of the first structures of Z-DNA it was observed that the phosphate groups can be rotated towards the outside of the helix in the ZI type or towards the inside in the ZII type of Z-DNA.
"A large number of crystal structures of Z-DNA oligomers are currently available in the Protein Data Bank, where both backbone types are observed, often co-existing as alternative, partially occupied conformations."
"At first it was postulated that the backbone conformation adopted by Z-DNA depends on the presence of metal cations and polyamines in the crystal structures, but later it was realized that the ZI and ZII conformations are not specific to the sequence or the interactions with metal ions [1]."
A comparison of larger number of high-resolution Z-DNA structures reveals that the structures can adopt a range of backbone torsion angles between the two values representing the canonical ZI and ZII types [2].
"A high-intensity mono-energetic positron beam generated by using a linear electron accelerator (linac) provides total reflection high-energy positron diffraction (TRHEPD) researches at Slow Positron Facility (SPF), KEK [1,2].   "
"A pulsed 50-Hz electron beam generated with a dedicated linac (operated at 55 MeV, 0.6 kW) is injected on a Ta converter and causes fast positron-electron pair creation through bremsstrahlung."
"The positrons showering down on 25  mu m-thick W foils, are moderated to thermal energy, and a fraction spontaneously comes out of the foils with an energy of 3 eV owing to the negative work function."
The positron converter/moderator assembly is held at an electrostatic voltage of 15 kV for TRHEPD experiment.
The emitted positrons are consequently accelerated to 15 keV as they enter the grounded beam-line and are guided by the magnetic field of about 0.015 T to the TRHEPD station.   
"For diffraction experiments, positrons transported by the magnetic field have to be first released into a nonmagnetic region."
"Since the released positron beam has a large diameter, a brightness-enhancement unit is effectively used to achieve a small-diameter and highly-parallel beam with a sufficient flux.   "
The linac-based positron beam gives about 60 times intensified diffraction pattern from a Si(111)-7x7 reconstructed surface compared to a previous result with a Na-22-based positron beam [3].
"An improved signal-to-noise ratio in the obtained pattern due to the intensified beam allowed an observation of clear fractional-order spots in the higher Laue-zones, which had not been observed previously."
The much intensified beam with the present system allows adjustment of the sample orientation without accumulating the positron signals.
"With the brightness enhanced beam, several remarkable results have been obtained efficiently by users of this facility."
Everybody is invited to use KEK Slow Positron Facility through approval of his/her research proposal.)
"We present the final design of the x-ray optical systems and experimental stations of the two macromolecular crystallography (MX) beamlines, FMX and AMX, at the National Synchrotron Light Source-II (NSLS-II)."
"Along with its companion x-ray scattering beamline, LIX, this suite of Advanced Beamlines for Biological Investigations with"

The Frontier Microfocusing Macromolecular Crystallography beamline (FMX) will deliver a photon flux of ~5x10^
12 ph/s at a wavelength of 1  Aring  into a spot of 1 - 50  micro m size.
"It will cover a broad energy range from 5 - 30 keV, corresponding to wavelengths from 0.4 - 2.5  Aring ."
"The highly Automated Macromolecular Crystallography beamline (AMX) will be optimized for high throughput applications, with beam sizes from 4 - 100  micro m, an energy range of 5 - 18 keV (0.7 - 2.5  Aring ), and a flux at 1  Aring  of ~10"
^13 ph/s.  
"Central components of the in-house-developed experimental stations are a 100 nm sphere of confusion goniometer with a horizontal axis, piezo-slits to provide dynamic beam size changes during diffraction experiments, a dedicated secondary goniometer for crystallization plates, and sample- and plate-changing robots.  "
"FMX and AMX will support a broad range of biomedical structure determination methods from serial crystallography on micron-sized crystals, to structure determination of complexes in large unit cells, to rapid sample screening and data collection of crystals in trays, for instance to characterize membrane protein crystals and to conduct ligand-binding studies.  "
"Together with the solution scattering program at LIX, the new beamlines will offer unique opportunities for advanced diffraction experiments with micro- and mini-beams, with next generation hybrid pixel array detectors and emerging crystal delivery methods such as acoustic droplet ejection."

Hydrogen (1H) is an element that is ubiquitous in chemistry and materials science.
"Neutron diffraction is the preferred technique for studying 1H-containing compounds, but is complicated by the high incoherent scattering cross section, which also varies with wavelength."
This variation of scattering cross section as a function of wavelength/energy and chemical environment is not well understood.[1-2
This is surprising as it is the largest contributing factor to the scattering properties used in single crystal and powder neutron diffraction experiments to calculate the optimal sample size for hydrogen containing compounds and the tabulated data are given for fixed neutron velocity of 2200 m s-1 (approximately 1.8  Aring ).
The use and current limitations of certain current generation neutron diffraction instruments to probe 1H materials has recently been described.[3]  
"Here, I present work to validate an empirical correction for the incoherent scattering cross section of 1H as a function of incident neutron wavelength in the range 0.5 - 10  Aring  using continuous source, monochromatic wavelength measurements."
"The practical use of this is that a, potentially quantitative, correction for all neutron diffraction data, including time-of-flight (TOF) from pulsed sources, as a function of scattering angle and neutron path length will become possible."
"Implementation of methodology that allows routine H position definition from easily synthesised material (i.e. non-isotopically enriched, and in polycrystalline or small single crystal ( le  50  mu m) form) for both TOF and monochromatic neutron instruments would be both of widespread application.  "
"Additionally, i will present work on an instrument concept for a pulsed monochromatic powder diffractometer for the ESS, which will be built in Lund by the end of the current decade."
This diffractometer will aim to specialise in the data collection and analysis of hydrogenous materials using a combination of diffraction and inelastic techniques.
"It has been shown mathematically that both the magnitudes and 3-phase invariants of the structure factors of a centrosymmetric crystal can be expressed explicitly in terms of the distances to specific features in the 3-beam convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) pattern [1].This theoretical inversion can be implemented experimentally, enabling direct observations of 3-phase invariants and the approximate measurement of structure factor magnitudes."
"This method then enables a different approach to crystal structure determination, which is based on the observation of phases, rather than the measurement of amplitudes."
"It has been shown that by inspection of just a few phases using 3-beam CBED patterns, centrosymmetric crystal structures can be determined directly to picometre precision without the need to measure magnitudes [2].  "
"Here, we will explore a different approach for measuring structure factor magnitudes from 3-beam CBED patterns."
It has been demonstrated that the relative structure factor magnitudes can be determined directly from the ratio of the intensity distributions along specific lines within the CBED discs [3].
We will investigate the potential of using this approach for the relatively fast measurement of approximate structure factor magnitudes from nano-scale volumes of crystals.
(FALCON) is a thermal neutron Laue diffractometer situated in the experimental hall of the BER-II reactor at HZB in Berlin.  
"The thermal beamtube, D1S, delivers a stream of neutrons direct to FALCON just 8m from the reactor core but with a low gamma radiation count.  "
FALCON benefits from a beam that does not pass through any objects upstream whilst a beam definer delivers a highly focused neutron beam to the instrument with  lt 10 divergence.  
The instrument comprises two scintillator plate detectors coupled to four iCCD cameras each.  
The neutron beam passes through the detector units enabling one detector to be placed in the backscattering position and the second detector in the transmission position.  
The image-intensified CCDs are capable of obtaining 20-bit digitization Laue images in under ten seconds and variable sample table and detector positions allow a full range of sample environments to be utilised.  
"Data from FALCON can be used to solve crystallographic structures and as a neutron instrument it has all the advantages of neutrons as a probe for condensed matter, for instance, identification of the location of hydrogen atoms within structures and differentiation between electronically similar elements."
FALCON will now enter the commissioning phase using in-house samples to test both ambient and sample environment conditions on the instrument.  
We present here details of the upcoming commissioning tests and invite users to submit proposals for Laue diffraction experiments.
"An impressive comparison of G(r) calculated with PDFgetX2(1) from data of Naphthalen taken at room temperature with a Stoe Stadi P powder diffractometer in Transmission mode equipped with a Ag-tube, a Ge(111)-monochromator for pure Ag-K alpha 1-radiation (0.5594  Aring ) as well as the Dectris MYTHEN 1K with1mm chip size and from synchrotron data, beamline X17A, NSLS Brookhaven with a wavelength of 0.1839  Aring , yields amazingly similar peak widths for both experiment sites.  "
"To observe the temperature dependence of this resolution, the same laboratory setup with an additional Oxford Cryosystems Cobra or a Stoe furnace has been chosen to compare the signal width as a function of T. Low temperature data for these PDF calculation experiments has been taken from LaB6 as a crystalline standard and Naphthalene as well known organic phase."
In addition high temperature G(r)-data from Ammonium Nitride will be demonstrated.
"In the title complex, [CuSm(C19H20N2O4)(NO3)3] middot CH3CO-CH3, the CuII atom is four-coordinated in a square-planar geometry by two O atoms and two N atoms of the deprotonated Schiff base."

All homogeneous sphere packings and all interpenetrating layers of spheres were derived that refer to the 22 orthorhombic bivariant lattice complexes.
"In total, sphere packings of 90 different types have been found."
Only for 47 of these types is the maximal inherent symmetry of their sphere packings orthorhombic.
Some examples demonstrate the usefulness of sphere packings for the comparison and description of crystal structures.
"As a part of a structural genomics program, the 2.2 emsp14  Aring  resolution crystal structure of the PurC gene product from Thermotoga maritima has been solved."
"This 26.2 emsp14 kDa protein belongs to the phophoribosylaminoimidazole-succinocarboxamide or SAICAR synthase family of enzymes, the members of which are involved in de novo purine biosynthesis."
SAICAR synthase can be divided into three subdomains: two  alpha + beta  regions exhibiting structural homology with ATP-binding proteins and a carboxy-terminal subdomain of two  alpha -helices.
The asymmetric unit contains two copies of the protein which are covalently linked by a disulfide bond between Cys126(A) and Cys126(B).
This 230-amino-acid protein exhibits high structural homology with SAICAR synthase from baker's yeast.
The protein structure is described and compared with that of the ATP ndash SAICAR synthase complex from yeast.

The Ag+ cation coordination geometry is best described as distorted T-shaped.
The crystal structure forms a three-dimensional structural polymer.
Pathogen-inducible oxygenase (PIOX) is a heme-containing membrane-associated protein found in monocotyledon and dicotyledon plants that utilizes molecular oxygen to convert polyunsaturated fatty acids into their corresponding 2R-hydroperoxides.
PIOX is a member of a larger family of fatty-acid  alpha -dioxygenases

"In this method, the specimen was rotated around the scattering vector."
"By rotating the specimen, the integrated intensity of higher-order reflections was significantly increased from that in the initial vertical position."
"The results obtained were explained by assuming that the specimen was bent around an axis on the surface of the specimen, with the axis deviating slightly from the direction parallel to the edge of the specimen."
"In the present paper, it is shown that the results can be clearly explained by a model where the specimen is uniformly bent with a small torsion around the axes parallel to the specimen edges."
"The present model is highly probable, as the axes of the bending and torsion are parallel to the edges of the specimen."

Recent applications of exact random-walk techniques to crystallographic structure-factor statistics have now been extended to multivariate joint probability density functions of several structure factors.
"The technique of deriving such multivariate exact density functions is introduced, and is applied to the study of the simplest sign relationship:  Sigma 1, in the space group P\bar 1."
"An exact expression is obtained for the probability that the sign of the normalized structure factor E(2h 2k 2l) is positive, given the magnitudes of E(2h 2k 2l) and E(h k l), and an extensive numerical examination of this new expression - as compared with the conventional asymptotic formula for this probability - is presented."
"It is shown that the asymptotic formula usually underestimates the probability that E(2h 2k 2l) is positive, the discrepancies between the exact and asymptotic results being rather serious when the atomic composition of the asymmetric unit is heterogeneous (even moderately so), and when the number of atoms is small; a paucity of atoms leads to significant discrepancies even in the equal-atom case."
"On the other hand, for large asymmetric units of low heterogeneity and for high E values, the exact and asymptotic expressions agree very well in their predictions."
The qualitative behaviour of the new exact expression is consistent with the known features of the  Sigma 1 relationship and its statistical interpretations.
Hemihedral twinning is a crystal-growth anomaly in which a specimen is composed of two crystal domains that coincide with each other in three dimensions.
"However, the orientations of the crystal lattices in the two domains differ in a specific way."
"In diffraction data collected from hemihedrally twinned crystals, each observed intensity contains contributions from both of the domains."
"With perfect hemihedral twinning, the two domains have the same volumes and the observed intensities do not contain sufficient information to detwin the data."
"Here, the use of molecular replacement and of noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) averaging to detwin a 2.1 emsp14  Aring  resolution data set for Aichi virus 1 affected by perfect hemihedral twinning is described."
The NCS averaging enabled the correction of errors in the detwinning introduced by the differences between the molecular-replacement model and the crystallized structure.

The errors in the synchrotron X-ray analyses are quite low (usually smaller than 1 emsp14 wt%).
The relative errors in the laboratory X-ray analyses are of the order of 2% for the main phases and increase to approximately 5 ndash 10% for the low-content components.
These errors are acceptable in the factory environment and the routine application of this methodology in the cement industry is being implemented.
Pathogens require protein-folding enzymes to produce functional virulence determinants.
"These foldases include the Dsb family of proteins, which catalyze oxidative folding in bacteria."
Bacterial disulfide catalytic processes have been well characterized in Escherichia coli K-12 and these mechanisms have been extrapolated to other organisms.
"However, recent research indicates that the K-12 complement of Dsb proteins is not common to all bacteria."
"Importantly, many pathogenic bacteria have an extended arsenal of Dsb catalysts that is linked to their virulence."
"To help to elucidate the process of oxidative folding in pathogens containing a wide repertoire of Dsb proteins, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium has been focused on."
"This Gram-negative bacterium contains three DsbA proteins: SeDsbA, SeDsbL and SeSrgA."
"Here, the expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary diffraction analysis of these three proteins are reported."
"SeDsbA, SeDsbL and SeSrgA crystals diffracted to resolution limits of 1.55, 1.57 and 2.6 emsp14  Aring  and belonged to space groups P21, P21212 and C2, respectively."
"Small-angle scattering curves of concentrated polymer solutions are calculated, by applying the calculation of the radial distribution function of random coil molecules to the general scattering theory of the solutions."
This issue of the Journal of Synchrotron Radiation is a special issue including papers from the PhotonDiag2015 workshop.
"Here, a brief introduction is given."
Crystallization of a linear polyethylene from the melt was followed in situ with the ORNL 10-meter SAXS camera [Hendricks (1978).
"11, 15 ndash 30]."
"Specimens were rapidly cooled in the X-ray beam in tandem birdcage furnaces from ~180 deg C to temperatures between 115 and 126 deg C, and scattering patterns were recorded for 30 emsp14 s in 50 emsp14 s intervals."
"Because of this relatively high-speed data acquisition rate, it was possible to obtain data in time periods which were short compared to the rate of change of the scattering patterns."
The SAXS curves showed shapes which changed continuously during crystallization.
The scattering curves are the superposition of a zero-angle peak and a Bragg maximum.
Guinier plots of the zero-angle peak manifest scattering by lamellae of constant thickness.
The thickness value is nearly that expected for crystallites at these crystallization temperatures.
A model in which skeletal spherulites form and then later fill in is consistent with these results.
Decreasing SAXS intensity and changing Bragg peak intensities indicate crystal thickening during cooling to room temperature.

General principles of the Ewald method for evaluating multipole lattice sums are reviewed.
"The method is used to derive an expression for the Lorentz-factor dipole tensor sum in a form convenient for computation, and comparisons are made with the direct and plane-wise summation methods."
Expressions are also given for computing quadrupole and octopole sums by the Ewald method.

Expression of the NDK from Litopenaeus vannamei (LvNDK) is known to be regulated under viral infection.

"In order to investigate the differences in selectivity, LvNDK was crystallized as binary complexes with both acceptor (dADP and dCDP) and donor (ADP) phosphate-group nucleoside diphosphate substrates and their structures were determined."
The three structures with purine or pyrimidine nucleotide ligands are all hexameric.
"Also, the binding of deoxy or ribonucleotides is similar, as in the former a water molecule replaces the hydrogen bond made by Lys11 to the 2 prime -hydroxyl group of the ribose moiety."
This allows Lys11 to maintain a catalytically favourable conformation independently of the kind of sugar found in the nucleotide.
"Because of this, shrimp NDK may phosphorylate nucleotide analogues to inhibit the viral infections that attack this organism."

The formulas are simple to calculate and some possible strategies for their use are discussed.
Phase-contrast X-ray diffraction imaging and high-angular-resolution diffraction combined with phase-contrast radiographic imaging were employed to characterize defects and perfection of a uniformly grown tetragonal lysozyme crystal in the symmetric Laue case.
"The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of a 4 emsp14 4 emsp14 0 rocking curve measured from the original crystal was  sim 16.7 emsp14 arcsec and imperfections including line defects, inclusions and other microdefects were observed in the diffraction images of the crystal."

Inclusions of impurities or formations of foreign particles in the central growth region are resolved in the images with high sensitivity to defects.
"Slow dehydration led to the broadening of a fairly symmetric 4 emsp14 4 emsp14 0 rocking curve by a factor of  sim 2.6, which was primarily attributed to the dehydration-induced microscopic effects that are clearly shown in X-ray diffraction images."

Crystal structure parameters for all studied compositions of (Nd1 minus xSmx)2Fe14B have been determined by full-profile Rietveld refinements.
"These results revealed that all intermediate alloys of (Nd1 minus xSmx)2Fe14B are similar to the end member of the investigated system, Nd2Fe14B, with a tetragonal structure (space group P42/mnm)."
The formation of continuous solid solutions has been found in this system.
The normalized lattice parameters and unit-cell volumes of (Nd1 minus xSmx)2Fe14B solid solutions decrease linearly with increasing Sm content.
The DTA measurements show that the melting temperature of (Nd1 minus xSmx)2Fe14B increases linearly with increasing Sm content and no metastable phases were detected.
"Based on the DTA data and XRD results, a tentative phase diagram for the pseudo-binary system Nd2Fe14B ndash Sm2Fe14B has been constructed."
It is the aim of comparative structural biology to define the evolutionarily important traits of protein function and the points of diversification.
"Consequently, structural analysis, especially of distant members in a family which in this case are lectins involved in cell adhesion and growth regulation in animals (i.e. galectins), is required."
"For this purpose, recent work has been focused on the first galectins known from outside the animal kingdom."
"These are the two isolectins from the basidiomycete Coprinus cinereus (inky cap mushroom), termed Cgl-1 and Cgl-2."
"Additionally, the close similarity (83% deduced amino-acid identity) but the pronounced difference in the expression patterns of these two fungal lectins during fruiting-body formation affords a suitable object for study of the relation of structural difference to the observed functional disparity in the same organism."
Both galectins were crystallized after recombinant production.

"After discriminating noise originating from  gamma -rays, and calibrating the positions and sensitivities of individual tubes, the resolution was determined (i.e. channel widths along parallel and vertical directions along a tube)."
The counting rate of one tube was determined to be 1.4  times  103 counts per second with a counting loss of 1%.
"This implies that the new detector, composed of 96 tubes, can detect more than 105 neutrons per second with a counting loss of 1%."
"To demonstrate its use, small-angle scattering originating from a diblock copolymer film with a highly oriented lamellar microdomain was observed."
The data acquisition in event mode has a great advantage in time-resolved measurements that are synchronized with external stimuli imposed on a sample.
The paper gives brief descriptions of new structure types observed for simple compounds of the 5f-series of elements and of related elements.
"An investigation of the dihalides of titanium, vanadium and chromium has been reported by Klemm  amp  Grimm (1942) in which they were unable to determine the crystal structure of TiCl2."
A furnace covering the temperature range from 298 to 1300 emsp14 K has been designed and constructed to study in situ the structural evolution of materials by using synchrotron X-ray microtomography.
"The furnace has cylindrical symmetry, compatible with the required 180 deg  rotation, small dimensions and low absorption."

Aib ndash CO ndash CO ndash Aib ndash OH (Gly is glycine and Aib is 2-aminoisobutyric acid).
The characteristic torsion angles in the title compound are close to those in peptide  alpha -helices.
"The title compound, [Cu2(C2H3O2)4(C7H7N)2], consists of centrosymmetric dinuclear units, in which four acetate groups bridge the two Cu atoms and a 4-vinylpyridine neutral ligand occupies the axial position of each Cu atom, coordinated to it through the pyridine N atom."
Each Cu atom has a distorted octahedral coordination.
O interactions contribute to the crystal packing stability.
The sensitivity of measurements of the lattice-parameter difference in monocrystalline heterostructures can be enhanced by use of an extremely asymmetrical diffraction geometry.
"If the angle of incidence is somewhat higher than the critical angle for total external reflection, the Bragg peak is shifted from the position calculated by kinematic theory."
The amount of shift depends on the angle of incidence as well as on the mass density of the material used.
For heteroepitaxic structures both the layer and the substrate peaks are shifted but by different amounts.
Therefore it becomes possible to characterize layers of totally lattice-matched structures also.
"The title compound, (C6H9N2)2 middot [ReO(H2O)Br4] middot Br, is a molecular salt incorporating rhenium(V)-containing oxoanions."

"Three orthorhombic crystals of chemical formula EuxVyMo8 plusmn zO14 were investigated by X-ray diffraction (Mo K alpha  radiation,  lambda  = 0.71073 emsp14  Aring )."
"They have nearly the same lattice parameters (a  sime  11.3, b  sime  10.0, c  sime  9.2 emsp14  Aring ), display one-dimensional incommensurate modulations of wavevector q* =  gamma"
c* and are characterized by the same superspace group Cmca(00 gamma )s00.
"The average structures of these crystals appear closely related to the structures of LaMo7.7O14 (not modulated) and LaMo8O14 (modulated); however, two main differences are outlined: first, the modulation direction is c in the Eu-containing crystals but b in the modulated La-containing crystal [q* = (1/3)b*], second, the Eu-containing crystals have centrosymmetric structures while the La-containing crystals have polar structures (space group C2ca)."
The Mo (or Mo and V) atoms are stacked to form (001) layers of metallic clusters.
"The density modulation of these structures implies the existence of the new types of clusters Mo9, Mo10, Mo6V4, Mo7V3 and Mo8V2 besides the clusters M8 (Mo8, Mo6V2 and Mo7V) and M7 (Mo7 and Mo6V) which are already known."
Mo8 units with cis and trans configurations and Mo6V2 units with a trans configuration appear as the main cluster types in these crystals.
"The nature of the metallic clusters changes along c, but inside one (001) layer"
it is likely that only one cluster type with a given configuration is present.
"The main structural result is the formation, in some unit cells, of strong intercluster Mo mdash Mo,"
Mo mdash V or V mdash V bonds with distances close to 2.6 emsp14  Aring  within a layer as well as between two neighbouring layers.
"The title copper(II) complex, [Cu(C22H18N6)2](ClO4)2 middot 2C2H3N, comprises two neutral substituted tris(pyrazol-1-yl)methane ligands bonded to a central CuII ion, which is positioned on a crystallographic inversion center."
Cu mdash N bonds are arranged in a distorted octahedral fashion.
"The unsubstituted pyrazole rings on each ligand are oriented trans with respect to each other, interdigitated with the two 3-phenylpyrazole rings of the other ligand."
"In the title complex, poly[cadmium(II)- mu 2-1,4-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene-di- mu 2-thiocyanato], [Cd(NCS)2(C12H12N6)]n, the CdII atom lies on an inversion centre in a distorted octahedral environment."
"Four N atoms from the thiocyanate and 1,4-bis(1,2,4-triazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene (bbtz) ligands occupy the equatorial positions, and two S atoms from symmetry-related thiocyanate ligands occupy the axial positions."
The benzene ring of the bbtz ligand lies about an inversion centre.
Single thiocyanate bridges link the CdII atoms into two-dimensional sheets containing novel 16-membered [Cd4( mu -NCS-N:S)4] rings.
The bbtz ligands further link these two-dimensional sheets into an unprecedented covalent three-dimensional network for the cadmium ndash thiocyanate system.
By the use of the continuous X-ray spectrum it is possible to determine the polarity of semiconductors of the blende type.
"Close to the absorption edges, the scattered intensities are different for (111) and (\overline 1 \overline 1 \overline 1) faces."
"Crystals of the bovine thrombin-hirudins51 ndash 65 complex have space group P6122 with cell constants a = 116.4, and c = 200.6 emsp14  Aring  and two thrombin molecules in the asymmetric unit."
Only one thrombin molecule could be located by generalized molecular replacement; the second was fit visually as a rigid body to an improved electron-density difference map.
The structure was refined to R = 0.192 with two B values per residue (main chain and side chain) at 3.2 emsp14  Aring .
The polar interactions of the peptides with the exosite of thrombin show differences consistent with the known flexibility in the interactions of the C-terminal peptide of hirudin with thrombin.
The hirudin peptide in complex 2 has a higher temperature factor as compared with peptide 1 which may be correlated partly with a larger number of short-range electrostatic interactions between peptide 1 and thrombin and partly with the fact that thrombin 2 is  epsiv -thrombin which is cleaved at Thr149A near the peptide binding site.
"Later, using this structure as a test case, it was shown that the position for the second thrombin could also be determined by a novel modification of the molecular-replacement method in which the contribution of the known molecule is subtracted from the structure factors."
This approach is facile and applicable to any crystal containing two or more macromolecules in the asymmetric unit in which some but not all of the molecules can be determined by molecular replacement.
The microstructure of a colloidal system with short-ranged inter-particle interactions is studied by ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering (USAXS).
A gas-liquid type transition can be induced when the short-ranged attractive interactions attain sufficient magnitude.
The static structure factor revealed a systematic development of attractive interactions prior to the appearance of the liquid-like structure.
The interparticle interaction in the close vicinity of the transition can be approximately described by a square-well potential with a hard-sphere repulsion.
"The colloid-rich phase is structurally similar to a liquid, but dynamically it shows extreme non-ergodic behaviour with a complete kinetic arrest."
"Furthermore, the USAXS intensity from the colloid-rich phase shows Porod behaviour indicating that the colloidal clusters have non-fractal morphology."
The attractive term disappears when the domains develop towards their final size suggesting that particles within the clusters interact like hard spheres.
"The anomalous scattering terms for trivalent holmium are measured for Cu K alpha 1, K alpha 2 and K beta  radiation in diffraction experiments with a crystal of HoNa(edta).8H2O. Intensities at these wavelengths and at Mo K alpha  are used to calculate amplitudes and the phase difference for the waves scattered by holmium and by the rest of the structure to test the multiple-wavelength method of diffraction phase determination."
Relative phases are determined with a mean accuracy of 44 deg  for 759 high-angle reflections.
A similar calculation for the analogous Sm crystal using synchrotron radiation data gives the phase difference with an average error of 5 deg .

Results of a statistical study of probabilistic estimates of two-phase structure invariants (TPSI) for Friedel pairs in the case of single-wavelength anomalous scattering are reported.

Small-angle neutron scattering is used to investigate porous alumina membranes ( gamma -Al2O3) made of parallel channels with cylindrical shape.
The membranes are produced by anodization of thin aluminium sheets.
The scattering experiments are performed in a coaxial geometry where the cylindrical pores are oriented with their long axis parallel to the incident beam resulting in isotropic scattering patterns due to the circular symmetry.
The results obtained with commercial Anodisc reg  membranes and membranes synthesized in our laboratory are compared to radialy averaged 2D Fourier transforms of electron microscopy images of the alumina membrane surface and to known values of the materials' porosity.
The contrast of dislocation images in X-ray section topographs of curved crystals has been investigated both experimentally and by computer simulation.
Good agreement is found between experiment and simulation in both symmetric and asymmetric Laue geometries.
Very little change is observed in the symmetric Laue images for radii of curvature as small as 18 emsp14 m.
"In the asymmetric geometry, the background intensity rises and the Kato fringe visibility decreases as the curvature increases."
The dynamical image becomes more localized and dominates the image as the direct image visibility falls.
Our results explain the reversal of dislocation contrast in Lang projection topographs of curved crystals taken in asymmetric geometry.
"It is shown that by considering the cylindrically averaged intensity diffracted by a non-crystalline fiber as being due to the atoms in one c repeat, rather than, as is usual, one helix repeat, some relationships in fiber diffraction can be easily derived."

At room temperature the background of X-ray single-crystal photographs exhibits diffuse streaks along the line  Delta  from  Gamma  to X and less sharp diffuse domains in the directions  Sigma .
The streaks are explained by a soft rotary phonon A2( Delta ) corresponding to an in-phase rotation of the octahedra in a plane.
The displacements of the Cl ions due to their librations are identified in a difference-
Fourier chart.
The second diffuse system is explained by a transversal accoustical mode B1( Sigma ).

"For the 220 reflexion the value is 23.78 plusmn 0.35, in good agreement with the theoretical value of 23.76."
Fine structure in the profile of the rocking curves has been observed in thickness regions close to

A careful inspection of the drawings and baked clay models created by the mineralogist Rom eacute  de L'Isle in the 18th century has revealed the existence of a number of intriguing forms with pentagonal symmetries.
These forms cannot be classified in any of the 32 crystal classes.
They can thus be considered the first crystallographic descriptions of polyhedral forms found in quasicrystals two centuries later.
This paper presents a symmetry analysis of the fascinating drawings and clay models with pentagonal symmetries described in the book Cristallographie published in 1783 by
"Rom eacute  de L'Isle, as well as a comparison with quasicrystals recently synthesized."
The paper also briefly discusses what could induce
Rom eacute  de L'Isle to consider forms with pentagonal symmetries as plausible crystal forms.

"Overwhelming evidence exists to show that the inclusion of weak-intensity, high-resolution X-ray diffraction data helps improve the refinement of atomic models by imposing strong constraints on individual and overall temperature B factors and thus the quality of crystal structures."
"Some researchers consider these data to be of little value and opt to discard them during data processing, particularly at medium and low resolution, at which individual B factors of atomic models cannot be refined."
"Here, new evidence is provided to show that the inclusion of these data helps to improve the quality of experimental phases by imposing proper constraints on electron-density models during noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) averaging."
"Using electron-density correlation coefficients as criteria, the resolution of data has successfully been extended from 3.1 to 2.5 emsp14  Aring  resolution with redundancy-independent merging R factors from below 100% to about 310%."

It is demonstrated that grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction is a direct tool for measuring the elastic displacement modes near the surface of a crystal.
"Due to the fact that X-ray diffraction is a Fourier transform of the electronic density, and thus, of the atomic positions, elastic displacement modes appear as additional spots in the reciprocal space."
Their characteristics can be directly derived from the elastic constants of the material.
"Measuring the amplitude of the diffracted wave for these peaks allows direct determination of the force distribution at the surface, which is at the origin of the elastic displacements."
Various examples of such determinations are given for self-organized surfaces and for vicinal surfaces.

Trivalent holmium ions were shown to isomorphously replace magnesium ions to form an ADP-2Ho complex in the nucleotide-binding domain of Bacillus subtilis
MTR) kinase.
This nucleotide ndash holmium complex provided sufficient phasing power to allow SAD and SIRAS phasing of this previously unknown structure using the LIII absorption edge of holmium.
The structure of ADP-2Ho reveals that the two Ho ions are approximately 4 emsp14  Aring  apart and are likely to share their ligands: the phosphoryl O atoms of ADP and a water molecule.
The structure determination of MTR kinase using data collected using Cu emsp14 K alpha  X-radiation was also attempted.
"Although the heavy-atom substructure determination was successful, interpretation of the map was more challenging."
The isomorphous substitution of holmium for magnesium in the MTR kinase ndash nucleotide complex suggests that this could be a useful phasing tool for other metal-dependent nucleotide-containing proteins.
Two-beam and symmetric three- and four-beam grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) by crystals without absorption are studied based on the dynamical theory of X-ray diffraction.

CARDO-R was crystallized at 277 emsp14 K using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method with the precipitant PEG 8000.
Two crystal types (types I and II) were obtained.
"The type I crystal diffracted to a maximum resolution of 2.80 emsp14  Aring  and belonged to space group P42212, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 158.7, c = 81.4 emsp14  Aring ."
"The type II crystal was obtained in drops from which type I crystals had been removed; it diffracted to 2.60 emsp14  Aring  resolution and belonged to the same space group, with unit-cell parameters a nbsp = nbsp b nbsp = nbsp 161.8, c = 79.5 emsp14  Aring ."

"The interdependence between the side of apical coordination (H2O,  gt C=O, dimethyl sulfoxide and Cl minus ) and steric crowding at the apical positions was investigated for a set of 20 copper(II) bis complexes with naturally occurring amino acids."
"As a measure of steric crowding the overlapping volumes, V*, were used, calculated by the modified overlapping spheres method."
It was found that the apically coordinated side of a complex is more hindered by the side-chain atoms.
"In addition, if both sides are apically coordinated, the apical bond is shorter at the more crowded side."
The interdependence between the length of the apical bond and distortion of the coordination polyhedron was also studied.
"The apical bond length shows sigmoidal dependence on the magnitude of distortion, and is also dependent on the kind of distortion (square-pyramidal or tetrahedral)."
"Structural anisotropy, for example texture, may govern important physical properties of thin film, such as electrical, magnetic and/or mechanical ones."
Texture (orientation information) is typically observed and quantified by the measurement of so-called pole figures.
An optimized experimental approach implemented at the DiffAbs beamline (Synchrotron SOLEIL) is presented here.
"Using an X-ray pixel area detector and synchrotron radiation sources, a complete pole figure (with resolutions adapted for metallic textured thin films, typically of the order of a few degrees) can be measured in time intervals as short as one minute."
The necessary corrections enabling complete pole figure retrieval from the experimental data using this optimized approach are provided and discussed.
A gain in measuring time by up to two orders of magnitude is found with respect to the use of a point detector (classical approach) under the same experimental conditions.

Charged-coupled device (CCD) detectors have been widely accepted as detectors for collecting X-ray diffraction images.
"The CCD detector offers a sensitive detection system well suited for diffraction analysis and, compared with other detectors on the market, a relatively rapid system for read-out of the collected image."
"The two predominant markets for the CCD detector have been those in which relatively short exposure times are used, i.e. small-molecule X-ray diffraction and large-molecule crystallography at high-intensity synchrotron sources."
CCD detectors have not been commonly used on rotating-anode X-ray sources for large-molecule crystallography.
Comparison of the performance of the CCD detectors with commercially available image-plate detectors shows that the CCD detectors function in a similar fashion to image-plate-based detectors.

A new approach to the interpretation and analysis of coherent inelastic neutron scattering from polycrystals (poly-CINS) is presented.
This article describes a simulation of the one-phonon coherent inelastic scattering from a lattice model of an arbitrary crystal system.
"The one-phonon component is characterized by sharp features, determined, for example, by boundaries of the (Q,  omega ) regions where one-phonon scattering is allowed."
"These features may be identified with the same features apparent in the measured total coherent inelastic cross section, the other components of which (multiphonon or multiple scattering) show no sharp features."
The parameters of the model can then be relaxed to improve the fit between model and experiment.
This method is of particular interest where no single crystals are available.
"To test the approach, the poly-CINS has been measured for polycrystalline aluminium using the MARI spectrometer (ISIS), because both lattice dynamical models and measured dispersion curves are available for this material."
The models used include a simple Lennard-Jones model fitted to the elastic constants of this material plus a number of embedded atom method force fields.
The agreement obtained suggests that the method demonstrated should be effective in developing models for other materials where single-crystal dispersion curves are not available.

The effects of simultaneous reflections on the intensities of reflections used in crystal structure analysis have been discussed by Zachariasen (1965) and by Moon  amp  Shull (1964) for cases where only secondary extinction need be considered.
In the present investigation the intensities of a number of reflections from a variety of crystals have been monitored in the course of azimuthal scans about the S vectors ( thetas  constant).
"These include several space group 'forbidden' reflections (of the type 010 in P21, etc.) and others of weak to medium intensity."

"The `mosaic' crystals investigated included ammonium oxalate, anthrone, Ca2VO4Cl, 1,2-trans-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid and L-alanyl, D-alanyl-2,5-diketopiperazine."
The effects observed vary widely from crystal to crystal and are often difficult to explain in terms of secondary extinction alone.
"Although in a few cases the incidence of simultaneous diffraction effects was surprisingly low, it is evident that the intensities of very weak reflections are often systematically overestimated because of simultaneous diffraction effects."
"The effects of unit-cell size, incident beam divergence, X-ray wavelength and other variables on the magnitudes of simultaneous diffraction effects will be discussed."

Computer simulations of the moir eacute  pattern formation have been made for the simple idealized case of two parallel gold-like lattices having a 10% difference in lattice constant.

Hydrogen bonds between solvent water molecules and these two independent chains generate a three-dimensional framework containing two-dimensional zigzag layers.
"Unlike other classical protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), PTPRQ (PTP receptor type Q) has dephosphorylating activity towards phosphatidylinositide (PI) substrates."
"Here, the structure of the catalytic domain of PTPRQ was solved at 1.56 emsp14  Aring  resolution."
"Overall, PTPRQ adopts a tertiary fold typical of other classical PTPs."
"However, the disordered M6 loop of PTPRQ surrounding the catalytic core and the concomitant absence of interactions of this loop with residues in the PTP loop results in a flat active-site pocket."
"On the basis of structural and biochemical analyses, it is proposed that this structural feature might facilitate the accommodation of large substrates, making it suitable for the dephosphorylation of PI substrates."
"Moreover, subsequent kinetic experiments showed that PTPRQ has a strong preferences for PI(3,4,5)P3 over other PI substrates, suggesting that its regulation of cell survival and proliferation reflects downregulation of Akt signalling."

A third construct containing a polyalanine linker between CTB and MPR proved to stabilize the pentameric form of the protein during purification.
The purification procedure was shown to produce a homogeneously pure and monodisperse sample for crystallization.

Odd electron diffraction patterns (EDPs) have been obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on silicon nanowires grown via the vapour ndash liquid ndash solid method and on silicon thin films deposited by electron beam evaporation.

The method uses principles taken from standard MIR phasing techniques and also can be used to process multiple-wavelength data to obtain the phases.
"A numerical example of phasing, using the anomalous scattering curves determined experimentally for cesium, is presented and the results discussed in terms of the applicability of multiple-wavelength  phasing  for  protein  crystallographic studies."
A survey of a variety of heavy metals suggests that large changes in anomalous scattering near the L absorption edges are quite general and will be of importance in multiple-wavelength phasing of single-crystal protein diffraction patterns.
"The Fielek model is made simple and more effective by modifying it for (a) purely central and short-range ionic interactions, (b) angular interactions coupling the nearby d shells, (c) easily computable volume interactions and (d) for crystal equilibrium in complicated f.c.c. lattices."
"The model, involving a minimum number of input data, is tested for its validity in predicting the dispersion relations in platinum."
"The distribution of divalent iron and nickel over two metal sites of differing coordination geometry in NiFe2(PO4)2, sarcopside, has been investigated by resonant X-ray and time-of-flight neutron powder diffraction."
"To assess the reproducibility of the X-ray technique, data have been collected from instruments X7A at Brookhaven National Laboratory and 8.3 at the Synchrotron Radiation Source, Daresbury Laboratory, England, using wavelengths  lambda X1 = 1.7437 emsp14 (3) emsp14  Aring  and  lambda X2 = 1.7434 emsp14 (1) emsp14  Aring , respectively, close to the Fe2+ K edge determined by X-ray absorption near-edge structure."
"The real part of the anomalous-scattering correction for iron at each energy, f prime (Fe)X1 =  minus 7.81 emsp14 (9) and f prime (Fe)X2 =  minus 10.16 emsp14 (6), was determined experimentally by diffraction from Fe3(PO4)2 under identical conditions."
"Occupancies obtained for iron at the M(1) site were found to be M(1)X1 = 0.366 emsp14 (6) and M(1)X2 = 0.376 emsp14 (3), compared with M(1)N = 0.26 emsp14 (15) from time-of-flight neutron powder diffraction."
A neutron diffraction study of Debye-Waller factors has been performed on ThC and ThC0.77 powder samples at 4 and 250 K on the high-resolution diffractometers D1A and D1B of HFR (Grenoble); 25 diffraction lines were resolved and analysed with wavelength  lambda  =
"1.21  Aring  on D 1A, and 22 lines with  lambda  = 1.28  Aring  on D1B."
"In the case of ThC, it is shown that the results (BTh = 0.07  plusmn  0.05  Aring 2 and BC = 0.40  plusmn  0.08  Aring 2 at 4 K; BTh = 0.32  plusmn  0.08  "
0.08  Aring 2 at 250 K) are mainly due to the thermal vibrations.
"For ThC0.77, we find BTh = 0.23  plusmn  0.03  Aring 2 and BC = 0.47  plusmn  0.05  "
"Aring 2 at 4 K, and BTh = 0.48  plusmn  0.04  Aring 2 and BC = 0.69  plusmn  0.05  Aring 2 at 250 K."
The enhancements of the Debye-Waller factors compared to the stoichiometric case are attributed to the static distortions induced by the presence of 23% vacancies in the carbon sublattice.
The mean-square static displacements of thorium and carbon atoms are found to be about 1% of the lattice parameter
x^{2}\rangle _{\rm Th} = 0.08  plusmn  0.03  
_{\rm c}\simeq _{\rm Th} 0.05  plusmn  0.03  Aring .
"The reaction of 2-methyl-1,3-benzothiazole (mebta) with mercury(II) chloride in methanol in a 1:1 molar ratio resulted in the formation of single crystals of the title compound, [HgCl2(C8H7NS)]n."
The molecules exist as continuous chlorine-bridged chains in which Hg atoms lie in distorted trigonal bipyramidal environments.
The equatorial positions are occupied by an N atom from the ligand [2.236 emsp14 (8) emsp14  Aring ] and two Cl atoms [2.428 emsp14 (3) and 2.459 emsp14 (3) emsp14  Aring ].
"The two axial Hg mdash Cl contacts to two neighbouring molecules [2.874 (3) and 2.964 emsp14 (3) emsp14  Aring ] are significantly shorter than the sum of the respective van der Waals radii, and form close to linear Cl mdash"
Hg mdash Cl sequences [177.80 (7) deg ].
The comparison of molecular structures is facilitated by a combination of graphical and numerical techniques.
"Conversion to a molecular reference frame makes the linear relationships between the molecules or fragments easily visualized, and can be used to produce diagrams clearly displaying the molecular similarities and differences."
"Small-angle scattering experiments of horse-spleen ferritin solutions have been performed at various wavelengths near the K absorption edge of iron, using synchrotron radiation from the storage ring DORIS."
The anomalous dispersion of the atomic form factor f as described by f' and if rdquo  has been monitored by the dependence of the radius of gyration R and the absorption coefficient  mu  respectively.
There is a 4% increase of R at the absorption edge.
The relative full half width of this peak of 0.0016 corresponding to 1 1 eV of the energy scale reflects the drastic variation of f' by 7 electrons.
The predictable relation between R and has been verified by the Kramers-Kronig relation.
"As small-angle scattering is primarily influenced by f', best advantage from anomalous dispersion in small-angle scattering can be taken by measurements very near the absorption edges."
The aetiologic agent of the recent epidemics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a positive-stranded RNA virus (SARS-CoV) belonging to the Coronaviridae family and its genome differs substantially from those of other known coronaviruses.
SARS-CoV is transmissible mainly by the respiratory route and to date there is no vaccine and no prophylactic or therapeutic treatments against this agent.
A SARS-CoV whole-genome approach has been developed aimed at determining the crystal structure of all of its proteins or domains.
These studies are expected to greatly facilitate drug design.
"The genomes of coronaviruses are between 27 and 31.5 emsp14 kbp in length, the largest of the known RNA viruses, and encode 20 ndash 30 mature proteins."

Positions of the anomalous scatterers were found by the direct-method program SAPI and used to normalize the anomalous differences before calculating the phase doublets.
2108 independent reflections and about 790 000  Sigma 2 relationships were involved in the phase derivation.
"The 'best phases' and the figures of merit obtained from the direct method were used to calculate a Fourier map, which revealed the essential feature of the structure."
"During an investigation of the SrO ndash CuO ndash P2O5 ndash H2O system, single crystals of distrontium hexahydroxidocuprate(II), Sr2[Cu(OH)6], were obtained by the hydrothermal method."
"The blue prismatic crystals of Sr2[Cu(OH)6] adopt the same structure type as Ba2[Cu(OH)6], Sr2[Zn(OH)6] and Ba2[Zn(OH)6]."
"The Cu atoms, located at (0, 0, 1\over2) (site symmetry \overline{1}), form mutually isolated and highly elongated Cu(OH)6 octahedra, which are interconnected to slightly distorted Sr(OH)6 trigonal prisms, forming a layered structure."
The location of H atoms from difference Fourier maps and their refinement allowed the precise determination of a three-dimensional hydrogen-bonding network in which all hydroxide O atoms are involved.
"In addition, the hydrogen-bonding topologies in Sr2[Cu(OH)6] and other similar hexahydroxidometallates with the general formulae M1[M2(OH)6], M12[M2(OH)6] and M13[M2(OH)6] were analysed in detail."
Streptococcus mutans SMU.1108c (KEGG database) encodes a functionally uncharacterized protein consisting of 270 amino-acid residues.
This protein is predicted to have a haloacid dehalogenase hydrolase-like domain and is a homologue of haloacid dehalogenase phosphatases that catalyze phosphoryl-transfer reactions.
"In this work, SMU.1108c was cloned into the pET28a vector and overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3)."

A multi-step purification scheme was used to achieve nbsp  gt 95% purity of CDO.

Protein ubiquitination in eukaryotic cells is mediated by diverse E3 ligase enzymes that each target specific substrates.
The cullin E3 ligase complexes are the most abundant class of E3 ligases; they contain various cullin components that serve as scaffolds for interaction with substrate-recruiting adaptor proteins.
"SPOP is a BTB-domain adaptor of the cullin-3 E3 ligase complexes; it selectively recruits substrates via its N-terminal MATH domain, whereas its BTB domain mediates dimerization and interactions with cullin-3."
It has recently been recognized that the high-order oligomerization of SPOP enhances the ubiquitination of substrates.
"Here, a dimerization interface in the SPOP C-terminus is identified and it is shown that the dimerization interfaces of the BTB domain and of the C-terminus act independently and in tandem to generate high-order SPOP oligomers."
The crystal structure of the dimeric SPOP C-terminal domain is reported at 1.5 emsp14  Aring  resolution and it is shown that Tyr353 plays a critical role in high-order oligomerization.

Radiation damage is an unwelcome and unavoidable aspect of macromolecular crystallography.
"In order to quantify the extent of X-ray-induced changes, knowledge of the dose (absorbed energy per unit mass) is necessary since it is the obvious metric against which to plot variables such as diffraction intensity loss and B factors."
Significant improvements to the program RADDOSE for accurately calculating the dose absorbed by macromolecular crystals are presented here.
"Specifically, the probability of energy loss through the escape of fluorescent photons from de-excitation of an atom following photoelectric absorption is now included."
"For lighter elements, both the probability of fluorescence and of its subsequent escape from the crystal are negligible, but for heavier atoms the chance of fluorescence becomes significant (e.g. 30% as opposed to Auger electron decay from a K-shell excited iron atom), and this has the effect of reducing the absorbed dose."
"The effects of this phenomenon on dose calculations are presented for examples of crystals of an iron-containing protein, 2-selenomethionine proteins, a uranium derivatised protein, and for a nucleic acid sample."
"For instance, the inclusion of fluorescent escape results in up to a 27% decrease in the calculated absorbed dose for a typical selenomethionine protein crystal irradiated at the selenium K-edge."

Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy is becoming an increasingly used tool for the element speciation in complex samples.
For phosphorus (P) almost all XANES measurements have been carried out at the K-edge.
The small number of distinctive features at the P K-edge makes in some cases the identification of different P forms difficult or impossible.
"As indicated by a few previous studies, the P L2,3-edge spectra were richer in spectral features than those of the P K-edge."
"However, experimentally consistent spectra of a wide range of reference compounds have not been published so far."
"In this study a library of spectral features is presented for a number of mineral P, organic P and P-bearing minerals for fingerprinting identification."
"Furthermore, the effect of radiation damage is shown for three compounds and measures are proposed to reduce it."
The spectra library provided lays a basis for the identification of individual P forms in samples of unknown composition for a variety of scientific areas.

"A method to determine the exact fiber identity periods (FIP) of polyamides from the X-ray meridional reflections has been found, which is essential especially for the  gamma  forms of polyamides with large values of the FIP."

"If the TDS correction of Bragg reflexions is evaluated by integrating the TDS interference function over the range of measurement, the correction is usually, as Cochran has pointed out, too large."
The magnitude of the 'overcorrection' is difficult to estimate since the proper evaluation of the correction involves the convolution of the interference function with the resolution function of the experimental set-up.
"Thus, in general, a sixfold integration is involved."
"Here calculations performed with a simple model which contains the essential features of the problem, and for which the integrations can be carried out properly, are reported."
It has been found that the size of the 'overcorrection' depends only a little upon the absolute size of the range of measurement but strongly upon the size of the range of measurement relative to the magnitude of instrumental broadening (Bragg peak).
With decreasing range of measurement relative to the Bragg peak the 'overcorrection' increases rapidly.
For typical experimental situations of single-crystal measurements the 'overcorrection' seems to amount to about 5 to 20% of the TDS correction.

The transformation laws for the weighting and covariance matrices of the components of the atomic vibration tensors are derived.
It is shown that the use of unit-weight matrices in the least-squares determination of the rigid-body vibration tensors TLS from the atomic vibration components leads to incompatible results when the TLS parameters are refined in different Cartesian coordinate systems.
Numerical results for some molecules showed that the differences in the obtained components of TLS usually lie within the range of two standard deviations.
If the covariances of the atomic vibration components are taken into account in some simple form the incompatibilities vanish.
